**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning:  
- The current levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203 are all at 0.022m, which is at their minimum level. According to the operational procedure, I cannot open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** until both **tank B202** and **tank B203** are at their minimum levels. Since they are, I will keep **valve_in0** open to fill **tank B201** to its maximum of 0.033m.  
- No other actions are required at this moment as the other valves remain closed until the filling of **tank B201** is complete.[00m

Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning:  
1. The current level of tank B201 is 0.029m, which is below the maximum limit of 0.033m.  
2. The levels in both tank B202 and tank B203 are at their minimum of 0.022m.  
3. Therefore, I can keep **valve_in0** open to continue filling **tank B201** until it reaches its maximum capacity.  
4. No other actions are required at this moment as the other valves are already in the correct state.[00m

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8.

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  )

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 to allow filling of tank B203, as it is currently closed and needs to be opened to proceed with the operation. 2. Close valve_in0 and valve_in1, as both tanks B201 and B202 are already filled to their maximum levels and should not be kept open. This will ensure that only the necessary valve (valve_in2) is open for the next step in the control sequence. 3. Maintain the current pump power at 1.0 (750W) as it is not causing any issues and is required for the operation of transferring liquids to tank B204.",

ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5.

ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO ALLOW FILLING OF TANK B203, AS IT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND NEEDS TO BE OPENED TO PROCEED WITH THE OPERATION. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 AND VALVE_IN1, AS BOTH TANKS B201 AND B202 ARE ALREADY FILLED TO THEIR MAXIMUM LEVELS AND SHOULD NOT BE KEPT OPEN. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT ONLY THE NECESSARY VALVE (VALVE_IN2) IS OPEN FOR THE NEXT STEP IN THE CONTROL SEQUENCE. 3.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to allow filling of tank B203, as it is currently closed and needs to be opened to proceed with the operation. 2. Close valve_in0 and valve_in1, as both tanks B201 and B202 are already filled to their maximum levels and should not be kept open. This will ensure that only the necessary valve (valve_in2) is open for the next step in the control sequence. 3. Maintain the current pump power at 1.0 (750W) as it is not causing any issues and is required for the operation of transferring liquids to tank B204.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are active. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to allow for the transfer of liquids into tank B204. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B201 open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 5. Maintain the pump power at 750W as it is already at the maximum required level for operation. This adjustment will ensure that the system operates within the expected parameters and resolves the issue flagged by the validation agent.",

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN2 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO ENSURE ONLY THE REQUIRED VALVES ARE ACTIVE. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201, AS IT IS CURRENTLY AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND BOTH B202 AND B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN TO ALLOW FOR THE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDS INTO TANK B204. 4. KEEP VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 OPEN TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM B201 TO B204. 5. MAINTAIN THE PUMP POWER AT 750W AS IT IS ALREADY AT THE MAXIMUM REQUIRED LEVEL FOR OPERATION. THIS ADJUSTMENT WILL ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM OPERATES WITHIN THE EXPECTED PARAMETERS AND RESOLVES THE ISSUE FLAGGED BY THE VALIDATION AGENT.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  )

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are active. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to allow for the transfer of liquids into tank B204. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B201 open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 5. Maintain the pump power at 750W as it is already at the maximum required level for operation. This adjustment will ensure that the system operates within the expected parameters and resolves the issue flagged by the validation agent.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 to allow filling of tank B203, as it is currently closed and is required for the operation. 2. Close valve_in0 and valve_in1, as both tanks B201 and B202 are already filled to their maximum levels and should not be open simultaneously with valve_in2. This ensures that only the necessary valve for filling tank B203 is open, complying with the operational sequence. 3. Maintain the current pump power at 750W, as it is already set to the maximum and does not require adjustment at this stage.",

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO ALLOW FILLING OF TANK B203, AS IT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND IS REQUIRED FOR THE OPERATION. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 AND VALVE_IN1, AS BOTH TANKS B201 AND B202 ARE ALREADY FILLED TO THEIR MAXIMUM LEVELS AND SHOULD NOT BE OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH VALVE_IN2. THIS ENSURES THAT ONLY THE NECESSARY VALVE FOR FILLING TANK B203 IS OPEN, COMPLYING WITH THE OPERATIONAL SEQUENCE. 3. MAINTAIN THE CURRENT PUMP POWER AT 750W, AS IT IS ALREADY SET TO THE MAXIMUM AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT AT THIS STAGE.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to allow filling of tank B203, as it is currently closed and is required for the operation. 2. Close valve_in0 and valve_in1, as both tanks B201 and B202 are already filled to their maximum levels and should not be open simultaneously with valve_in2. This ensures that only the necessary valve for filling tank B203 is open, complying with the operational sequence. 3. Maintain the current pump power at 750W, as it is already set to the maximum and does not require adjustment at this stage.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are active. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to allow for the mixing process in tank B204. 4. Keep the pump power at its current setting of 1.0 (750W) as it is sufficient for the operation. This adjustment will ensure that the correct sequence of filling and emptying tanks is followed, allowing for proper mixing and operation of the plant.",

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are active. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to allow for the mixing process in tank B204. 4. Keep the pump power at its current setting of 1.0 (750W) as it is sufficient for the operation. This adjustment will ensure that the correct sequence of filling and emptying tanks is followed, allowing for proper mixing and operation of the plant.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340976549M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN2 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO ENSURE ONLY THE REQUIRED VALVES ARE ACTIVE. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201, AS IT IS CURRENTLY AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND BOTH B202 AND B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN TO ALLOW FOR THE MIXING PROCESS IN TANK B204. 4. KEEP THE PUMP POWER AT ITS CURRENT SETTING OF 1.0 (750W) AS IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE OPERATION. THIS ADJUSTMENT WILL ENSURE THAT THE CORRECT SEQUENCE OF FILLING AND EMPTYING TANKS IS FOLLOWED, ALLOWING FOR PROPER MIXING AND OPERATION OF THE PLANT.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B201. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B202. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203, as it is currently not open and needs to be filled to proceed with the operation. 4. Maintain the current state of the pump power at 750W, as it is already at maximum and does not require adjustment. This sequence will ensure that the operation can continue correctly by filling tank B203, which is necessary for the mixing process.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340976549M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO PREVENT FURTHER FILLING OF TANK B201. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO PREVENT FURTHER FILLING OF TANK B202. 3. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO FILL TANK B203, AS IT IS CURRENTLY NOT OPEN AND NEEDS TO BE FILLED TO PROCEED WITH THE OPERATION. 4. MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PUMP POWER AT 750W, AS IT IS ALREADY AT MAXIMUM AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT. THIS SEQUENCE WILL ENSURE THAT THE OPERATION CAN CONTINUE CORRECTLY BY FILLING TANK B203, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR THE MIXING PROCESS.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are open. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 remains open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow filling of tank B204. 5. Maintain the current pump power at 750W as it is sufficient for the operation. These actions will correct the issue of valve_in2 being incorrectly open and ensure the proper sequence of filling and emptying tanks is followed.",

    7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
    8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
    9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
    10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:**

  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_IN2 IS NOT OPEN OR EXACTLY 1 DESIRED VALVE IS NOT OPEN..
  - IDENTIFY THE VALVES/PUMP POWER CASUING THIS ISSUE AND SUGGEST CORRECTIVE ACTION.
  - IF MORE VALVES ARE OPEN THEN REQUIRED, SUGGEST CLOSING THE EXTRA VALVES AND ONLY KEEPING THE REQUIRED VALVES OPEN.
  - DO NOT CHANGE THE PUMP POWER IF NOT REQUIRED.
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

**WHAT TO DO:** - ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND DETECTED FAULTS AND MANIPULATE THE ACUTATORS TO OVERCOME THE ISSUES.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** - LIST OF NEW VALVE/PUMP COMMANDS. - REASONING FOR EACH CHANGE. - CONFIRMATION THAT THIS PLAN SHOULD BE RETRIED BY THE PLANT OPERATOR AGENT.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are open. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 remains open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow filling of tank B204. 5. Maintain the current pump power at 750W as it is sufficient for the operation. These actions will correct the issue of valve_in2 being incorrectly open and ensure the proper sequence of filling and emptying tanks is followed.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340976549M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN2 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO ENSURE ONLY THE REQUIRED VALVES ARE OPEN. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201, AS IT IS CURRENTLY AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND BOTH B202 AND B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 REMAINS OPEN TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM B201 TO B204. 4. KEEP VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 OPEN TO ALLOW FILLING OF TANK B204. 5. MAINTAIN THE CURRENT PUMP POWER AT 750W AS IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE OPERATION. THESE ACTIONS WILL CORRECT THE ISSUE OF VALVE_IN2 BEING INCORRECTLY OPEN AND ENSURE THE PROPER SEQUENCE OF FILLING AND EMPTYING TANKS IS FOLLOWED.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**

      ]
    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B201. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B202. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 4. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 remains open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 5. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow filling of tank B204. 6. Maintain the pump power at 1.0 (750W) as it is sufficient for the current operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are active. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 remains open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow filling of tank B204. 5. No changes to pump power are necessary as it is already set to maximum. These actions will correct the current state by ensuring the correct valves are open and the system can proceed with the mixing operation effectively.",

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340976549M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN2 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO ENSURE ONLY THE REQUIRED VALVES ARE ACTIVE. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201, AS IT IS CURRENTLY AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND BOTH B202 AND B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 REMAINS OPEN TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM B201 TO B204. 4. KEEP VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 OPEN TO ALLOW FILLING OF TANK B204. 5. NO CHANGES TO PUMP POWER ARE NECESSARY AS IT IS ALREADY SET TO MAXIMUM. THESE ACTIONS WILL CORRECT THE CURRENT STATE BY ENSURING THE CORRECT VALVES ARE OPEN AND THE SYSTEM CAN PROCEED WITH THE MIXING OPERATION EFFECTIVELY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in2 (currently open) to ensure only the required valves are active. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201, as it is currently at maximum capacity and both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 remains open to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow filling of tank B204. 5. No changes to pump power are necessary as it is already set to maximum. These actions will correct the current state by ensuring the correct valves are open and the system can proceed with the mixing operation effectively.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 REMAINS OPEN TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM B201 TO B204. 4. KEEP VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 OPEN TO ALLOW FILLING OF TANK B204. 5. NO CHANGES TO PUMP POWER ARE NECESSARY AS IT IS ALREADY SET TO MAXIMUM. THESE ACTIONS WILL CORRECT THE CURRENT STATE BY ENSURING THE CORRECT VALVES ARE OPEN AND THE SYSTEM CAN PROCEED WITH THE MIXING OPERATION EFFECTIVELY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows:

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B201. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B202. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203, as it is currently at 0.029m and needs to reach its maximum of 0.033m. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow for the mixing process in tank B204. 5. Maintain the current state of the pump power at 1.0 (750W) as it is sufficient for the operation. This sequence will ensure that the required tank B203 is filled while preventing overfilling of B201 and B202, which are already at maximum capacity. Once B203 is filled, the operator can proceed with the next steps of the mixing process.",

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO PREVENT FURTHER FILLING OF TANK B201. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO PREVENT FURTHER FILLING OF TANK B202. 3. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO FILL TANK B203, AS IT IS CURRENTLY AT 0.029M AND NEEDS TO REACH ITS MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. KEEP VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 OPEN TO ALLOW FOR THE MIXING PROCESS IN TANK B204. 5. MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE PUMP POWER AT 1.0 (750W) AS IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR THE OPERATION. THIS SEQUENCE WILL ENSURE THAT THE REQUIRED TANK B203 IS FILLED WHILE PREVENTING OVERFILLING OF B201 AND B202, WHICH ARE ALREADY AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY. ONCE B203 IS FILLED, THE OPERATOR CAN PROCEED WITH THE NEXT STEPS OF THE MIXING PROCESS.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B201. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently open) to prevent further filling of tank B202. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203, as it is currently at 0.029m and needs to reach its maximum of 0.033m. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open to allow for the mixing process in tank B204. 5. Maintain the current state of the pump power at 1.0 (750W) as it is sufficient for the operation. This sequence will ensure that the required tank B203 is filled while preventing overfilling of B201 and B202, which are already at maximum capacity. Once B203 is filled, the operator can proceed with the next steps of the mixing process.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 (currently open) to ensure only the necessary valves are open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow the liquid from tank B202 to flow into tank B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to continue filling tank B204 with the mixed liquids. This adjustment is necessary because the validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open, which is required for the operation to proceed correctly. By closing valve_pump_tank_B203, we ensure compliance with the operational requirements, allowing the system to function as intended without excess valve openings.",

    1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
    2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
    3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
    4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
    5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
    6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
    7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 (currently open) to ensure only the necessary valves are open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow the liquid from tank B202 to flow into tank B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to continue filling tank B204 with the mixed liquids. This adjustment is necessary because the validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open, which is required for the operation to proceed correctly. By closing valve_pump_tank_B203, we ensure compliance with the operational requirements, allowing the system to function as intended without excess valve openings.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0331175789872009M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO ENSURE ONLY THE NECESSARY VALVES ARE OPEN. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B202 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. 3. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN TO CONTINUE FILLING TANK B204 WITH THE MIXED LIQUIDS. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS NOT OPEN, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE OPERATION TO PROCEED CORRECTLY. BY CLOSING VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, WE ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION AS INTENDED WITHOUT EXCESS VALVE OPENINGS.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 (currently open) to ensure only the necessary valves are active. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow the liquid from tank B202 to flow into tank B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to facilitate the filling of tank B204 with the mixed liquids. This adjustment is necessary because the validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open, which is critical for the operation to proceed. By closing valve_pump_tank_B203, we eliminate any unnecessary flow and focus on the required operations. The pump power remains unchanged as it is already set to the maximum required for the current operation.",

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 (currently open) to ensure only the necessary valves are active. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow the liquid from tank B202 to flow into tank B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to facilitate the filling of tank B204 with the mixed liquids. This adjustment is necessary because the validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open, which is critical for the operation to proceed. By closing valve_pump_tank_B203, we eliminate any unnecessary flow and focus on the required operations. The pump power remains unchanged as it is already set to the maximum required for the current operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0331175789872009M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO ENSURE ONLY THE NECESSARY VALVES ARE ACTIVE. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B202 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. 3. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN TO FACILITATE THE FILLING OF TANK B204 WITH THE MIXED LIQUIDS. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS NOT OPEN, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR THE OPERATION TO PROCEED. BY CLOSING VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, WE ELIMINATE ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW AND FOCUS ON THE REQUIRED OPERATIONS. THE PUMP POWER REMAINS UNCHANGED AS IT IS ALREADY SET TO THE MAXIMUM REQUIRED FOR THE CURRENT OPERATION.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS NOT OPEN OR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. EXACTLY 2 DESIRED VALVES ARE NOT OPEN..
  - IDENTIFY THE VALVES/PUMP POWER CASUING THIS ISSUE AND SUGGEST CORRECTIVE ACTION.
  - IF MORE VALVES ARE OPEN THEN REQUIRED, SUGGEST CLOSING THE EXTRA VALVES AND ONLY KEEPING THE REQUIRED VALVES OPEN.
  - DO NOT CHANGE THE PUMP POWER IF NOT REQUIRED.
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0

  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_pump_tank_B203 is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from B203. 2. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to continue filling tank B204 with the mixed liquids from B201, B202, and B203. This valve is currently open, so no action is needed here. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 if it is not required to maintain the operation of transferring from B203 to B204. However, since it is currently open and is not causing any issues, it can remain open for now. The focus should be on opening valve_pump_tank_B203 to resolve the flagged issue.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to ensure the operation proceeds effectively."

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING THE TRANSFER OF LIQUID FROM B203. 2. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN TO CONTINUE FILLING TANK B204 WITH THE MIXED LIQUIDS FROM B201, B202, AND B203. THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN, SO NO ACTION IS NEEDED HERE. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IF IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATION OF TRANSFERRING FROM B203 TO B204. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND IS NOT CAUSING ANY ISSUES, IT CAN REMAIN OPEN FOR NOW. THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON OPENING VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO RESOLVE THE FLAGGED ISSUE.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_pump_tank_B203 is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from B203. 2. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to continue filling tank B204 with the mixed liquids from B201, B202, and B203. This valve is currently open, so no action is needed here. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 if it is not required to maintain the operation of transferring from B203 to B204. However, since it is currently open and is not causing any issues, it can remain open for now. The focus should be on opening valve_pump_tank_B203 to resolve the flagged issue.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202. REASON: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN BUT IS NOT REQUIRED SINCE WE NEED TO FILL TANK B204 FROM TANK B203. 2. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204. REASON: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN BUT SHOULD BE CLOSED TO ALLOW THE TRANSFER FROM TANK B203 TO B204. 3. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203. REASON: THIS VALVE NEEDS TO BE OPENED TO TRANSFER THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO TANK B204. AFTER THESE CHANGES, THE SYSTEM WILL BE CORRECTLY SET UP TO TRANSFER THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO TANK B204, ENSURING THAT THE OPERATION CAN PROCEED AS INTENDED.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B202. Reason: This valve is currently open but is not required since we need to fill tank B204 from tank B203. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B204. Reason: This valve is currently open but should be closed to allow the transfer from tank B203 to B204. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B203. Reason: This valve needs to be opened to transfer the liquid from tank B203 to tank B204. After these changes, the system will be correctly set up to transfer the liquid from tank B203 to tank B204, ensuring that the operation can proceed as intended.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows:

    )

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow the liquid from B204 to flow into the mixing tank. This is necessary because the current state indicates that this valve is closed, which is preventing the mixing process from proceeding. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 since it is currently open and is not required at this stage of the operation. The liquid from B203 has already been transferred, and keeping this valve open is unnecessary and could lead to further complications. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 remain closed as they are not needed at this moment. This will help maintain the correct flow sequence and prevent any overflow or mixing issues. 4. Confirm that the pump power remains at 1.0 times the maximum pump power, as it is already set correctly and does not require adjustment at this time.",

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0442459356967249M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM B204 TO FLOW INTO THE MIXING TANK. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT THIS VALVE IS CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING THE MIXING PROCESS FROM PROCEEDING. 2. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND IS NOT REQUIRED AT THIS STAGE OF THE OPERATION. THE LIQUID FROM B203 HAS ALREADY BEEN TRANSFERRED, AND KEEPING THIS VALVE OPEN IS UNNECESSARY AND COULD LEAD TO FURTHER COMPLICATIONS. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 REMAIN CLOSED AS THEY ARE NOT NEEDED AT THIS MOMENT. THIS WILL HELP MAINTAIN THE CORRECT FLOW SEQUENCE AND PREVENT ANY OVERFLOW OR MIXING ISSUES. 4. CONFIRM THAT THE PUMP POWER REMAINS AT 1.0 TIMES THE MAXIMUM PUMP POWER, AS IT IS ALREADY SET CORRECTLY AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT AT THIS TIME.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow the liquid from B204 to flow into the mixing tank. This is necessary because the current state indicates that this valve is closed, which is preventing the mixing process from proceeding. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 since it is currently open and is not required at this stage of the operation. The liquid from B203 has already been transferred, and keeping this valve open is unnecessary and could lead to further complications. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 remain closed as they are not needed at this moment. This will help maintain the correct flow sequence and prevent any overflow or mixing issues. 4. Confirm that the pump power remains at 1.0 times the maximum pump power, as it is already set correctly and does not require adjustment at this time.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that tank B203 is full, and we need to transfer its contents to B204 to continue the mixing process. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 if it is not required to keep it open while emptying the tanks. However, since it is currently open and necessary for filling B204, we will keep it open. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 remain closed as they are not needed at this stage. This will prevent any unnecessary flow and maintain the operational intent of the system.",

  )

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that tank B203 is full, and we need to transfer its contents to B204 to continue the mixing process. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 if it is not required to keep it open while emptying the tanks. However, since it is currently open and necessary for filling B204, we will keep it open. 3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 remain closed as they are not needed at this stage. This will prevent any unnecessary flow and maintain the operational intent of the system.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.044254359499781M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT TANK B203 IS FULL, AND WE NEED TO TRANSFER ITS CONTENTS TO B204 TO CONTINUE THE MIXING PROCESS. 2. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IF IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING THE TANKS. HOWEVER, SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND NECESSARY FOR FILLING B204, WE WILL KEEP IT OPEN. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 REMAIN CLOSED AS THEY ARE NOT NEEDED AT THIS STAGE. THIS WILL PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW AND MAINTAIN THE OPERATIONAL INTENT OF THE SYSTEM.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 (currently open) to stop transferring liquid from tank B203. This is necessary because the system is not in the correct state to empty tank B203 into tank B204, as valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow the liquid from tanks B201, B202, and B203 to flow into tank B204. This is essential for the mixing process to continue as tank B204 needs to be filled with the liquids from the other tanks. 3. Ensure that valve_in0 and valve_in1 remain closed, as they are not needed at this stage of the operation. 4. Maintain the pump power at its current setting of 1.0 (750W) since it is already at maximum and does not require adjustment. These actions will ensure that the system can proceed with the mixing operation effectively.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent."

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO STOP TRANSFERRING LIQUID FROM TANK B203. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOT IN THE CORRECT STATE TO EMPTY TANK B203 INTO TANK B204, AS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. 2.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 (currently open) to stop transferring liquid from tank B203. This is necessary because the system is not in the correct state to empty tank B203 into tank B204, as valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow the liquid from tanks B201, B202, and B203 to flow into tank B204. This is essential for the mixing process to continue as tank B204 needs to be filled with the liquids from the other tanks. 3. Ensure that valve_in0 and valve_in1 remain closed, as they are not needed at this stage of the operation. 4. Maintain the pump power at its current setting of 1.0 (750W) since it is already at maximum and does not require adjustment. These actions will ensure that the system can proceed with the mixing operation effectively.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  )

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.044254359499781M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO STOP TRANSFERRING LIQUID FROM TANK B203. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOT IN THE CORRECT STATE TO EMPTY TANK B203 INTO TANK B204, AS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE MIXING PROCESS TO CONTINUE AS TANK B204 NEEDS TO BE FILLED WITH THE LIQUIDS FROM THE OTHER TANKS. 3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_IN0 AND VALVE_IN1 REMAIN CLOSED, AS THEY ARE NOT NEEDED AT THIS STAGE OF THE OPERATION. 4. MAINTAIN THE PUMP POWER AT ITS CURRENT SETTING OF 1.0 (750W) SINCE IT IS ALREADY AT MAXIMUM AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT. THESE ACTIONS WILL ENSURE THAT THE SYSTEM CAN PROCEED WITH THE MIXING OPERATION EFFECTIVELY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open, which is required to empty tank B203. 2. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open as it is already open, allowing the mixed liquid to flow into tank B204. This valve must stay open to facilitate the mixing process. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 if they are inadvertently open, as they are not needed at this stage since we are focusing on emptying tank B203 into B204. This will ensure that only the necessary valves are open, preventing any potential flow obstruction or confusion in the operation.",

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS NOT OPEN, WHICH IS REQUIRED TO EMPTY TANK B203. 2. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN AS IT IS ALREADY OPEN, ALLOWING THE MIXED LIQUID TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS VALVE MUST STAY OPEN TO FACILITATE THE MIXING PROCESS. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IF THEY ARE INADVERTENTLY OPEN, AS THEY ARE NOT NEEDED AT THIS STAGE SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ON EMPTYING TANK B203 INTO B204. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT ONLY THE NECESSARY VALVES ARE OPEN, PREVENTING ANY POTENTIAL FLOW OBSTRUCTION OR CONFUSION IN THE OPERATION.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open, which is required to empty tank B203. 2. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open as it is already open, allowing the mixed liquid to flow into tank B204. This valve must stay open to facilitate the mixing process. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 if they are inadvertently open, as they are not needed at this stage since we are focusing on emptying tank B203 into B204. This will ensure that only the necessary valves are open, preventing any potential flow obstruction or confusion in the operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.044254359499781M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS NOT OPEN, WHICH IS REQUIRED TO EMPTY TANK B203. 2. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN AS IT IS ALREADY OPEN, ALLOWING THE MIXED LIQUID TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS VALVE MUST STAY OPEN TO FACILITATE THE MIXING PROCESS. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IF THEY ARE INADVERTENTLY OPEN, AS THEY ARE NOT NEEDED AT THIS STAGE SINCE WE ARE FOCUSING ON EMPTYING TANK B203 INTO B204. THIS WILL ENSURE THAT ONLY THE NECESSARY VALVES ARE OPEN, PREVENTING ANY POTENTIAL FLOW OBSTRUCTION OR CONFUSION IN THE OPERATION.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.
