"Current liquid levels indicate that all tanks B201, B202, and B203 are at their maximum level of 0.033m. The procedure requires emptying these tanks into B204. Therefore, I should proceed to open the pumping valves. First, open valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill B204 and commence the transfer process. Then open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from B201 to B204.",0.033,0.033,0.033,0.022,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1269,229,1498,1269,229,1479
"The current state indicates that tank B201 is at its minimum level and below the maximum fill threshold (current level 0.0219999998977998m), while tanks B202 and B203 are full at 0.033m. According to the operational procedure, once B201 reaches its minimum level, valve_pump_tank_B201 should be closed and valve_pump_tank_B202 should be opened to start emptying B202 into B204. Since B204's level is already at 0.0331281487708265m and all operations are dependent on the current levels respectively, closing valve_pump_tank_B201 is advised. The valve_pump_tank_B204 should remain open to allow the transfer into B204.",0.0219999998977998,0.033,0.033,0.0331281487708265,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2548,496,3044,1279,267,1479
