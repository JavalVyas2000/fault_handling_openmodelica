"Currently, the level of tank B201 has reached 0.0219999998977998m, which is close to the minimum limit, as valve_pump_tank_B201 is already open. The transfer from B201 to B204 should continue until it reaches the minimum level fully. All the steps mentioned rely on maintaining the correct valve configuration, focusing specifically on the current settings until B201 is emptied to its minimum capacity as defined. Therefore, the system should continue with the current settings, as the levels for the tanks are appropriate for the task, with B202 and B203 being at 0.033m, the maximum level, indicating they are ready for the next transfer. No changes are required at this time, allowing the process to complete naturally as per the procedure.",0.0219999998977998,0.033,0.033,0.0331284206839114,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,3,1363,272,1635,1363,272,1609
"The current state of the system indicates that tank B201 is at 0.0219999998977998m, which means it is at its minimum level and not yet emptied completely between 0.021m and 0.22m. According to the operational procedure, it should continue pumping liquid from B201 to B204. With valve_pump_tank_B201 set to 1 (open) and valve_pump_tank_B204 set to 1 (open), the system is currently operating as intended. No changes in valve positions are required right now.",0.0219999998977998,0.033,0.033,0.0331368444871414,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,4,2726,518,3244,1363,246,1609
