**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0331283758433468M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the transfer of liquid from B203 to B204. This is necessary because B203 is full and needs to be emptied into B204. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to facilitate the transfer of liquids from B201, B202, and B203 into B204. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 as it is currently open, but B202 has already reached its minimum level, and the transfer should now be from B203 to B204.",

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ALLOW THE TRANSFER OF LIQUID FROM B203 TO B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE B203 IS FULL AND NEEDS TO BE EMPTIED INTO B204. 2. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDS FROM B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 AS IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN, BUT B202 HAS ALREADY REACHED ITS MINIMUM LEVEL, AND THE TRANSFER SHOULD NOW BE FROM B203 TO B204.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  )

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the transfer of liquid from B203 to B204. This is necessary because B203 is full and needs to be emptied into B204. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open to facilitate the transfer of liquids from B201, B202, and B203 into B204. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 as it is currently open, but B202 has already reached its minimum level, and the transfer should now be from B203 to B204.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
