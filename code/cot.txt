[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** **Filling Phase:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
**Emptying Phase:** 1. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 2. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 3. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 4. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
**Final Step:** - Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
**Expected Action:** - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** **Filling Phase:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
**Emptying Phase:** 1. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 2. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 3. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 4. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
**Final Step:** - Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0270092535702673m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.01m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
**Expected Action:** - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** **Filling Phase:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
**Emptying Phase:** 1. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 2. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 3. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 4. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
**Final Step:** - Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.01m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
**Expected Action:** - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** **Filling Phase:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
**Emptying Phase:** 1. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 2. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 3. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 4. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
**Final Step:** - Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.01m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
**Expected Action:** - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** **Filling Phase:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
**Emptying Phase:** 1. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 2. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 3. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 4. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
**Final Step:** - Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0270092535700416m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.01m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 1 - The valve_in2 is 1 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 1
**Expected Action:** - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

}  

Actions to take:  
1. **Close valve_pump_tank_B202**: This should happen as Tank B202 is full and we're about to move to the next tank.   
2. **Open valve_pump_tank_B201**: Emptying Tank B201 is the priority since it is full.   
3. **Monitor Tank Levels**: After Tank B201 is emptied, we can then proceed to the next tank state to keep operations flowing.  

Conclusion: Keeping track of the tanks and controlling the flow is crucial to ensure we meet the safe operating limits and complete the mixing and emptying procedure correctly.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** **Filling Phase:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
**Emptying Phase:** 1. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 2. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 3. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 4. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
**Final Step:** - Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0210183820817782m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.01m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 1 - The valve_in2 is 1 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 1
**Expected Action:** - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
