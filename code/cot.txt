[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 6. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 7. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 6. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 7. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033001m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033001m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 6. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 7. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033001m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 6. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 7. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033001m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 6. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 7. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033001m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

No actions required at this moment as the levels for tanks B202 and B203 are still below maximum capacity, and tank B201 is already at maximum capacity. Current operation state needs to wait until B202 and B203 reach their maximum before taking further action.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 6. Once **B201** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204**. 7. Once **B202** is empty, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204**. 8. Once **B203** is empty, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 9. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** as required.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033001m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.02m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.02m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
