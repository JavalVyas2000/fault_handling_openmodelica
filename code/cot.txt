[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The operation procedure requires that Tank B201, B202, and B203 be sequentially filled and then emptied into B204. Currently, B201 is full, and valve_in0 is already closed as per procedure. The next step is to close valve_in1 which is currently open because B202 has not yet reached the maximum capacity (0.033m). Thus no valve operations are to be made at this moment since B202 is still filling.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 1 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340939436m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 1 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Since the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203 are all at 0.0330000001033m, which is their maximum capacity and all tanks are full, the next step is to begin emptying those tanks into B204. However, the required action to start that process involves opening valve_pump_tank_B204 first to keep it open while emptying B201, B202, and B203. We will then start by opening valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer liquid from B201 to B204.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331281474506919m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442562817018458m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Currently, Tank B202 is being emptied due to valve_pump_tank_B202 being open. The level in Tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m which is already at the lower limit as per the operational instructions (min level between 0.021m and 0.22m). As per the operational procedure and the current state, the following actions are appropriate: Close valve_pump_tank_B202 as the minimum level has been reached in Tank B202, and open valve_pump_tank_B203 to begin emptying Tank B203 into Tank B204. Continue to keep valve_pump_tank_B204 open as we are still in the process of transferring liquids to Tank B204.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0552954145040031m  - The valve_in0 is 0  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.

**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[1m[94m 
[2025-04-14 14:40:20][âœ… TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0552954145040031M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 1  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.

**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

Currently, both tanks B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels, which means we can proceed to fill tank B201. However, B201 is also at its minimum level. According to the operational procedure, if tanks B202 and B203 are at their minimum and B201 is not filled to its maximum, we should open valve_in0 to fill B201. This is the only required action at this moment because the levels havenâ€™t hit their maximum or require other actions.
