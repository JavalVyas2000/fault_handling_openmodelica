[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  "pump_power": 0.0
}  

Reasoning:  
- The current levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203 are all at their minimum of 0.022m.  
- Since the operational procedure states that valve_in0 should be opened to fill tank B201 only if both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels, I will keep valve_in0 open to fill B201.  
- No other actions are required at this moment as the filling process for B201 has just begun.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

}  

Reasoning: The current levels in tanks B202 and B203 are both at their minimum of 0.022m, which allows for the filling of tank B201. Since the level in tank B201 is currently at 0.029m, it is below the maximum limit of 0.033m. Therefore, I will keep **valve_in0** open to fill tank B201 until it reaches its maximum capacity. No other actions are required at this moment as the subsequent steps depend on the filling of tank B201.[00m

[1m[94m 
[2025-04-23 18:56:29][üìã TASK STARTED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

}  

Reasoning Process:  
1. The current level of tank B201 is at its maximum capacity of 0.033m, so I will close **valve_in0**.
2. The levels in tanks B202 and B203 are both at their minimum of 0.022m, which allows me to proceed to the next step.
3. I will open **valve_in1** to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m.  
4. The other valves remain unchanged as we are currently filling tank B202.  

This sequence of actions ensures that we are following the operational procedure correctly and maintaining safe operating limits.[00m

**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.
  - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
    - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
    - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204

- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in0 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in1 to stop filling tank B202. Reason: The current operation is incorrect as valve_in0 should be open to fill tank B201, and we need to halt the incorrect filling of B202. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201. Reason: This is necessary to ensure that tank B201 is filled to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, as both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Increase pump power to 750W. Reason: This will ensure that the pumps can effectively transfer the liquids from the tanks to B204 without obstruction. 4. Monitor the system for any further clogging issues. Reason: Continuous monitoring will help identify if the clogging persists and if further actions are needed to clear the lines. 5. Once tank B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and proceed with the sequence to fill B202 and B203 as per the original control sequence. Reason: This will ensure that the mixing process can continue as intended after resolving the current issue.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in1 to stop filling tank B202. Reason: The current operation is incorrect as valve_in0 should be open to fill tank B201, and we need to halt the incorrect filling of B202. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201. Reason: This is necessary to ensure that tank B201 is filled to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, as both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Increase pump power to 750W. Reason: This will ensure that the pumps can effectively transfer the liquids from the tanks to B204 without obstruction. 4. Monitor the system for any further clogging issues. Reason: Continuous monitoring will help identify if the clogging persists and if further actions are needed to clear the lines. 5. Once tank B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and proceed with the sequence to fill B202 and B203 as per the original control sequence. Reason: This will ensure that the mixing process can continue as intended after resolving the current issue.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 TO STOP FILLING TANK B202. REASON: THE CURRENT OPERATION IS INCORRECT AS VALVE_IN0 SHOULD BE OPEN TO FILL TANK B201, AND WE NEED TO HALT THE INCORRECT FILLING OF B202. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201. REASON: THIS IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT TANK B201 IS FILLED TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M, AS BOTH B202 AND B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 750W. REASON: THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE PUMPS CAN EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER THE LIQUIDS FROM THE TANKS TO B204 WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY FURTHER CLOGGING ISSUES. REASON: CONTINUOUS MONITORING WILL HELP IDENTIFY IF THE CLOGGING PERSISTS AND IF FURTHER ACTIONS ARE NEEDED TO CLEAR THE LINES. 5. ONCE TANK B201 IS FILLED, CLOSE VALVE_IN0 AND PROCEED WITH THE SEQUENCE TO FILL B202 AND B203 AS PER THE ORIGINAL CONTROL SEQUENCE. REASON: THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE MIXING PROCESS CAN CONTINUE AS INTENDED AFTER RESOLVING THE CURRENT ISSUE.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in1 to stop filling tank B202. Reason: The current operation is incorrect as valve_in0 should be open to fill tank B201, and we need to halt the incorrect filling of B202. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201. Reason: This is necessary to ensure that tank B201 is filled to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, as both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Increase pump power to 750W. Reason: This will ensure that the pumps can effectively transfer the liquids from the tanks to B204 without obstruction. 4. Monitor the system for any further clogging issues. Reason: Continuous monitoring will help identify if the clogging persists and if further actions are needed to clear the lines. 5. Once tank B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and proceed with the sequence to fill B202 and B203 as per the original control sequence. Reason: This will ensure that the mixing process can continue as intended after resolving the current issue.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-23 18:57:25][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 TO STOP FILLING TANK B202. REASON: THE CURRENT OPERATION IS INCORRECT AS VALVE_IN0 SHOULD BE OPEN TO FILL TANK B201, AND WE NEED TO HALT THE INCORRECT FILLING OF B202. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201. REASON: THIS IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT TANK B201 IS FILLED TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M, AS BOTH B202 AND B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 750W. REASON: THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE PUMPS CAN EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER THE LIQUIDS FROM THE TANKS TO B204 WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY FURTHER CLOGGING ISSUES. REASON: CONTINUOUS MONITORING WILL HELP IDENTIFY IF THE CLOGGING PERSISTS AND IF FURTHER ACTIONS ARE NEEDED TO CLEAR THE LINES. 5. ONCE TANK B201 IS FILLED, CLOSE VALVE_IN0 AND PROCEED WITH THE SEQUENCE TO FILL B202 AND B203 AS PER THE ORIGINAL CONTROL SEQUENCE. REASON: THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE MIXING PROCESS CAN CONTINUE AS INTENDED AFTER RESOLVING THE CURRENT ISSUE.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in1 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop any ongoing transfer from B201 to B204. This is necessary to prevent further clogging and to allow for a reset of the system. 2. Open valve_in1 to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. This will ensure that tank B202 is filled and ready for the next step in the sequence. 3. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 to ensure they are at the required levels before proceeding. 4. If the clogging persists, consider adjusting the pump power to 500W to see if this alleviates the issue. 5. Once tank B202 is filled, close valve_in1 and open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 6. After tank B203 is filled, open valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill tank B204 while emptying tanks B201, B202, and B203 sequentially. 7. Ensure that the output valve (valve_out) is opened to allow for the mixed liquid to be emptied from tank B204 once all tanks are emptied. 8. If any further issues arise, repeat the analysis and adjust the valves and pump power accordingly.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop any ongoing transfer from B201 to B204. This is necessary to prevent further clogging and to allow for a reset of the system. 2. Open valve_in1 to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. This will ensure that tank B202 is filled and ready for the next step in the sequence. 3. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 to ensure they are at the required levels before proceeding. 4. If the clogging persists, consider adjusting the pump power to 500W to see if this alleviates the issue. 5. Once tank B202 is filled, close valve_in1 and open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 6. After tank B203 is filled, open valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill tank B204 while emptying tanks B201, B202, and B203 sequentially. 7. Ensure that the output valve (valve_out) is opened to allow for the mixed liquid to be emptied from tank B204 once all tanks are emptied. 8. If any further issues arise, repeat the analysis and adjust the valves and pump power accordingly.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning Process:  
1. **Close valve_pump_tank_B201**: This is necessary to stop any ongoing transfer from B201 to B204, preventing further clogging and allowing for a reset of the system.
2. **Open valve_in1**: This action is taken to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, ensuring that it is ready for the next step in the sequence.
3. **Monitor levels**: Continuous monitoring of the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 is essential to ensure they are at the required levels before proceeding with further actions.
4. **Pump power adjustment**: If clogging persists, adjusting the pump power to 500W may be necessary to alleviate the issue.
5. **Next steps**: Once tank B202 is filled, the next actions will involve closing valve_in1 and opening valve_in2 to fill tank B203, followed by opening valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill tank B204 while emptying tanks B201, B202, and B203 sequentially. Finally, the output valve (valve_out) will be opened to allow for the mixed liquid to be emptied from tank B204 once all tanks are emptied.[00m
