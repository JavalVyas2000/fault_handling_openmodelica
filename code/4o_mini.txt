[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:**  **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

}  

Reasoning Process: 
- The current levels of all tanks (B201, B202, B203) are at 0.022m, which means they are at the minimum level.
- The control sequence indicates that valve_in0 must remain open to fill tank B201 to a maximum level of 0.033m, which can only be done if tanks B202 and B203 are both at their minimum.
- Since all conditions are met (minimum levels in both B202 and B203), valve_in0 is correctly set to 1 to allow filling of B201.
- The other valves and pumping operations must remain closed or inactive at this moment since we are still in the filling phase of tank B201. 
- Thus, the status of valves and pump power remains in their initial state as described above.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:**  **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning Process:  
1. The level in tank B201 is currently at 0.029m, which is below the maximum level of 0.033m, and the levels in tanks B202 and B203 are both at their minimum (0.022m).
2. Since the conditions for filling tank B201 are met, I close valve_in0 now as it is already full, and proceed to open valve_in1 to fill tank B202.
3. I will not adjust the pump power or any other valves as tank B204 is at its minimum, and the other filling operations are yet to start. Thus I remain at the same state while intending to fill B202.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m

  - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in0 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in0 (set valve_in0 to 1.0) to allow flow into the system. This is crucial since it is currently closed, and its status being 0 prevents any inflow to the tanks. 2. Increase the pump power (set pump power to 0.5 or 375W) to provide sufficient energy to combat any potential flow obstructions and ensure adequate flow rates throughout the system. 3. Verify the state of other valves to ensure there are no blockages or misconfigurations in other solenoid valves for B201, B202, B203, and B204. 4. Monitor the tank levels after making these changes for an appropriate duration to ensure that they begin to rise and that flow is restored. This multi-step approach addresses the flow obstruction and ensure that tank B201 and others can function effectively, meeting operational needs.",
  "confirmation": "This recovery plan should be executed by the plant operator agent as an immediate action to rectify the flagged issue and restore normal operation."

  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in0 (set valve_in0 to 1.0) to allow flow into the system. This is crucial since it is currently closed, and its status being 0 prevents any inflow to the tanks. 2. Increase the pump power (set pump power to 0.5 or 375W) to provide sufficient energy to combat any potential flow obstructions and ensure adequate flow rates throughout the system. 3. Verify the state of other valves to ensure there are no blockages or misconfigurations in other solenoid valves for B201, B202, B203, and B204. 4. Monitor the tank levels after making these changes for an appropriate duration to ensure that they begin to rise and that flow is restored. This multi-step approach addresses the flow obstruction and ensure that tank B201 and others can function effectively, meeting operational needs. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  "pump_power": 0.5
}  

Reasoning Process:  
1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. This is necessary because the current levels in both **tank B202** and **tank B203** are at their minimum of 0.022m.  
2. Set **pump_power** to 0.5 times the maximum pump power (375W) to ensure enough force can be generated to overcome potential clogging and maintain proper flow rates throughout the system.
3. Leave **valve_in1** open as it is already providing flow from **tank B202** since **B201** has not yet reached its maximum capacity. Valves for pumping **B202**, **B203**, and emptying **B204** are currently closed since they have not yet reached their respective filling or emptying conditions.

By taking these actions, I am actively working to support the proper operation of the plant while ensuring all safety and operational guidelines are followed. The focus remains on monitoring the system after these adjustments to confirm that the tank levels stabilize and flow resumes as expected.[00m

[2025-04-22 20:33:03][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.2 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN0 (SET VALVE_IN0 TO 1.0) TO ALLOW FLOW INTO THE SYSTEM. THIS IS CRUCIAL SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, AND ITS STATUS BEING 0 PREVENTS ANY INFLOW TO THE TANKS. 2. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER (SET PUMP POWER TO 0.5 OR 375W) TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO COMBAT ANY POTENTIAL FLOW OBSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE ADEQUATE FLOW RATES THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. 3. VERIFY THE STATE OF OTHER VALVES TO ENSURE THERE ARE NO BLOCKAGES OR MISCONFIGURATIONS IN OTHER SOLENOID VALVES FOR B201, B202, B203, AND B204. 4. MONITOR THE TANK LEVELS AFTER MAKING THESE CHANGES FOR AN APPROPRIATE DURATION TO ENSURE THAT THEY BEGIN TO RISE AND THAT FLOW IS RESTORED. THIS MULTI-STEP APPROACH ADDRESSES THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION AND ENSURE THAT TANK B201 AND OTHERS CAN FUNCTION EFFECTIVELY, MEETING OPERATIONAL NEEDS. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

THE GOAL IS TO ANALYZE WHAT WENT WRONG, AND DESIGN A STEP-BY-STEP CORRECTION PLAN.
**CURRENT STATE:**
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M

  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  - THE PUMP IS SPEED-CONTROLLED VIA AN INPUT SHAFT SPEED N (RPM), WITH A NOMINAL SPEED OF 166.43 RPM. THE AGENT CAN VARY THE INPUT SPEED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FLOW.
  - THE PUMP FOLLOWS A QUADRATIC HEAD VS. FLOW RATE RELATIONSHIP. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE PUMP CAN DELIVER GREATER HEAD AND FLOW. THE FLOW DIRECTION IS FIXED DUE TO A BUILT-IN CHECK VALVE (NO FLOW REVERSAL ALLOWED). 
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_IN2 IS NOT OPEN OR EXACTLY 1 DESIRED VALVE IS NOT OPEN. (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER).
- FAULT DETECTED BY MONITORING AGENT IS  (E.G., CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204).
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

**WHAT TO DO:** - ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND DETECTED FAULTS AND MANIPULATE THE ACUTATORS TO OVERCOME THE ISSUES.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** - LIST OF NEW VALVE/PUMP COMMANDS. - REASONING FOR EACH CHANGE. - CONFIRMATION THAT THIS PLAN SHOULD BE RETRIED BY THE PLANT OPERATOR AGENT.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 1.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 1.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 to allow flow from tank B201, B202, B203 to B204. This is critical since the validation agent flagged that valve_in2 is not open, which is necessary for enabling the flow of liquids between tanks. 2. Increase pump power to 0.8 (600W) to overcome the current flow obstruction and to ensure that the pump can operate effectively against the system head. With higher pump power, we can also compensate for any potential clogging that may be present in the lines. 3. Check the status of all valves after these adjustments to ensure they are functioning correctly and that flow is restored. This includes monitoring tanks for level changes to confirm fluid movement. 4. Should the problem persist after adjustments, consider inspection and possible cleaning of the line connecting the tanks to eliminate any physical obstructions. Restart the operations after initial adjustments and continue monitoring system statuses closely.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to allow flow from tank B201, B202, B203 to B204. This is critical since the validation agent flagged that valve_in2 is not open, which is necessary for enabling the flow of liquids between tanks. 2. Increase pump power to 0.8 (600W) to overcome the current flow obstruction and to ensure that the pump can operate effectively against the system head. With higher pump power, we can also compensate for any potential clogging that may be present in the lines. 3. Check the status of all valves after these adjustments to ensure they are functioning correctly and that flow is restored. This includes monitoring tanks for level changes to confirm fluid movement. 4. Should the problem persist after adjustments, consider inspection and possible cleaning of the line connecting the tanks to eliminate any physical obstructions. Restart the operations after initial adjustments and continue monitoring system statuses closely. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 20:33:21][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.5 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B201, B202, B203 TO B204. THIS IS CRITICAL SINCE THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_IN2 IS NOT OPEN, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR ENABLING THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS BETWEEN TANKS. 2. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 0.8 (600W) TO OVERCOME THE CURRENT FLOW OBSTRUCTION AND TO ENSURE THAT THE PUMP CAN OPERATE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST THE SYSTEM HEAD. WITH HIGHER PUMP POWER, WE CAN ALSO COMPENSATE FOR ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING THAT MAY BE PRESENT IN THE LINES. 3. CHECK THE STATUS OF ALL VALVES AFTER THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE THEY ARE FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY AND THAT FLOW IS RESTORED. THIS INCLUDES MONITORING TANKS FOR LEVEL CHANGES TO CONFIRM FLUID MOVEMENT. 4. SHOULD THE PROBLEM PERSIST AFTER ADJUSTMENTS, CONSIDER INSPECTION AND POSSIBLE CLEANING OF THE LINE CONNECTING THE TANKS TO ELIMINATE ANY PHYSICAL OBSTRUCTIONS. RESTART THE OPERATIONS AFTER INITIAL ADJUSTMENTS AND CONTINUE MONITORING SYSTEM STATUSES CLOSELY. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 to 1.0 (fully open).\n2. Increase the pump power to 1.0 (750W).\n3. Open the valve_pump_tank_B201 to 1.0 (fully open). \n4. Temporarily close valve_pump_tank_B204 to 0.0 (fully closed) for the duration of the intended flow to tanks B201, B202, and B203. \n\nReasoning: 1. Opening valve_in2 will allow for proper flow connectivity, as the validation agent flagged this valve as not open. This is crucial for maintaining the intended flow path. 2. Increasing the pump power to maximum will overcome any possible flow obstructions and ensure enough pressure to deliver the necessary flow rates. 3. Opening valve_pump_tank_B201 will direct flow from tank B201 into the system for proper filling and operation, given its low level. 4. Closing valve_pump_tank_B204 stops the conflicting flow which may be creating obstruction and ensures that the flow from B201 is directed properly into the lower tanks. This sequence should effectively address the validation agent's flagged issue and re-establish normal operational parameters.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to 1.0 (fully open).
2. Increase the pump power to 1.0 (750W).
3. Open the valve_pump_tank_B201 to 1.0 (fully open). 
4. Temporarily close valve_pump_tank_B204 to 0.0 (fully closed) for the duration of the intended flow to tanks B201, B202, and B203. 

Reasoning: 1. Opening valve_in2 will allow for proper flow connectivity, as the validation agent flagged this valve as not open. This is crucial for maintaining the intended flow path. 2. Increasing the pump power to maximum will overcome any possible flow obstructions and ensure enough pressure to deliver the necessary flow rates. 3. Opening valve_pump_tank_B201 will direct flow from tank B201 into the system for proper filling and operation, given its low level. 4. Closing valve_pump_tank_B204 stops the conflicting flow which may be creating obstruction and ensures that the flow from B201 is directed properly into the lower tanks. This sequence should effectively address the validation agent's flagged issue and re-establish normal operational parameters. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

REASONING: 1. OPENING VALVE_IN2 WILL ALLOW FOR PROPER FLOW CONNECTIVITY, AS THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THIS VALVE AS NOT OPEN. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE INTENDED FLOW PATH. 2. INCREASING THE PUMP POWER TO MAXIMUM WILL OVERCOME ANY POSSIBLE FLOW OBSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO DELIVER THE NECESSARY FLOW RATES. 3.

CLOSING VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 STOPS THE CONFLICTING FLOW WHICH MAY BE CREATING OBSTRUCTION AND ENSURES THAT THE FLOW FROM B201 IS DIRECTED PROPERLY INTO THE LOWER TANKS. THIS SEQUENCE SHOULD EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE VALIDATION AGENT'S FLAGGED ISSUE AND RE-ESTABLISH NORMAL OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0320275227796819m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to 1.0 (fully open).
2. Increase the pump power to 1.0 (750W).
3. Open the valve_pump_tank_B201 to 1.0 (fully open). 
4. Temporarily close valve_pump_tank_B204 to 0.0 (fully closed) for the duration of the intended flow to tanks B201, B202, and B203. 

Reasoning: 1. Opening valve_in2 will allow for proper flow connectivity, as the validation agent flagged this valve as not open. This is crucial for maintaining the intended flow path. 2. Increasing the pump power to maximum will overcome any possible flow obstructions and ensure enough pressure to deliver the necessary flow rates. 3. Opening valve_pump_tank_B201 will direct flow from tank B201 into the system for proper filling and operation, given its low level. 4. Closing valve_pump_tank_B204 stops the conflicting flow which may be creating obstruction and ensures that the flow from B201 is directed properly into the lower tanks. This sequence should effectively address the validation agent's flagged issue and re-establish normal operational parameters. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 20:34:16][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0320275227796819M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.5  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.8 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO 1.0 (FULLY OPEN).
2. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (750W).
3. OPEN THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO 1.0 (FULLY OPEN). 
4. TEMPORARILY CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO 0.0 (FULLY CLOSED) FOR THE DURATION OF THE INTENDED FLOW TO TANKS B201, B202, AND B203. 

REASONING: 1. OPENING VALVE_IN2 WILL ALLOW FOR PROPER FLOW CONNECTIVITY, AS THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THIS VALVE AS NOT OPEN. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE INTENDED FLOW PATH. 2. INCREASING THE PUMP POWER TO MAXIMUM WILL OVERCOME ANY POSSIBLE FLOW OBSTRUCTIONS AND ENSURE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO DELIVER THE NECESSARY FLOW RATES. 3. OPENING VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 WILL DIRECT FLOW FROM TANK B201 INTO THE SYSTEM FOR PROPER FILLING AND OPERATION, GIVEN ITS LOW LEVEL. 4. CLOSING VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 STOPS THE CONFLICTING FLOW WHICH MAY BE CREATING OBSTRUCTION AND ENSURES THAT THE FLOW FROM B201 IS DIRECTED PROPERLY INTO THE LOWER TANKS. THIS SEQUENCE SHOULD EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE VALIDATION AGENT'S FLAGGED ISSUE AND RE-ESTABLISH NORMAL OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0320275227796819m

  - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 by setting it to 1.0. This is necessary as the validation agent flagged this valve as not being open, which is required for proper flow. \n2. Increase the pump power to 1.0 (750W). Currently, it is running at 0.8 times maximum, and for optimal flow and to overcome any possible flow obstruction due to the clogging anomaly, we need to provide maximum power to ensure sufficient head pressure and flow rate.\n3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains at 0.5 to maintain some flow dynamics for tank B204.\n4. Confirm the operation of valve_out is set at 0.0 to prevent undesired flow during adjustments and avoid a possible drop in system pressure until flow restoration is ensured.  \n5. Monitor tank levels after implementing these changes, specifically B201 and B202, to ensure they are approaching their desired operational levels, facilitating smooth operation thereafter.",

**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 BY SETTING IT TO 1.0. THIS IS NECESSARY AS THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THIS VALVE AS NOT BEING OPEN, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR PROPER FLOW. 
2. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (750W). CURRENTLY, IT IS RUNNING AT 0.8 TIMES MAXIMUM, AND FOR OPTIMAL FLOW AND TO OVERCOME ANY POSSIBLE FLOW OBSTRUCTION DUE TO THE CLOGGING ANOMALY, WE NEED TO PROVIDE MAXIMUM POWER TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT HEAD PRESSURE AND FLOW RATE.
3. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS AT 0.5 TO MAINTAIN SOME FLOW DYNAMICS FOR TANK B204.
4. CONFIRM THE OPERATION OF VALVE_OUT IS SET AT 0.0 TO PREVENT UNDESIRED FLOW DURING ADJUSTMENTS AND AVOID A POSSIBLE DROP IN SYSTEM PRESSURE UNTIL FLOW RESTORATION IS ENSURED.  
5. MONITOR TANK LEVELS AFTER IMPLEMENTING THESE CHANGES, SPECIFICALLY B201 AND B202, TO ENSURE THEY ARE APPROACHING THEIR DESIRED OPERATIONAL LEVELS, FACILITATING SMOOTH OPERATION THEREAFTER. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0320275227796819m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 by setting it to 1.0. This is necessary as the validation agent flagged this valve as not being open, which is required for proper flow. 
2. Increase the pump power to 1.0 (750W). Currently, it is running at 0.8 times maximum, and for optimal flow and to overcome any possible flow obstruction due to the clogging anomaly, we need to provide maximum power to ensure sufficient head pressure and flow rate.
3. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains at 0.5 to maintain some flow dynamics for tank B204.
4. Confirm the operation of valve_out is set at 0.0 to prevent undesired flow during adjustments and avoid a possible drop in system pressure until flow restoration is ensured.  
5. Monitor tank levels after implementing these changes, specifically B201 and B202, to ensure they are approaching their desired operational levels, facilitating smooth operation thereafter. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2: This valve should be set to 1.0 to allow flow from tanks B203 and B204 towards B201 and B202, thereby overcoming the flagged issue of valve_in2 not being open. 2. Adjust pump power to 0.75 (562.5W): Increasing pump power will enhance flow capacity, which can help mitigate any potential flow obstructions caused by clogging anomalies in the line connecting the tanks. 3. Operate valve_pump_tank_B203 and valve_pump_tank_B204 at 1.0: Increasing the pump outputs for these tanks ensures they contribute efficiently to the flow, assisting in overcoming any obstructions caused by low flow rates. 4. Wait for a monitoring period to assess tank levels: After executing these valve changes and the pump power adjustment, there should be a brief period to monitor tank levels to ensure that they move towards desired levels and rectify the clogging anomaly effectively.",
  "confirmation": "This recovery strategy should be attempted by the plant operator to resolve the issues flagged by the validation agent and ensure proper flow within the plant system."

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0320275227796819m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2: This valve should be set to 1.0 to allow flow from tanks B203 and B204 towards B201 and B202, thereby overcoming the flagged issue of valve_in2 not being open. 2. Adjust pump power to 0.75 (562.5W): Increasing pump power will enhance flow capacity, which can help mitigate any potential flow obstructions caused by clogging anomalies in the line connecting the tanks. 3. Operate valve_pump_tank_B203 and valve_pump_tank_B204 at 1.0: Increasing the pump outputs for these tanks ensures they contribute efficiently to the flow, assisting in overcoming any obstructions caused by low flow rates. 4. Wait for a monitoring period to assess tank levels: After executing these valve changes and the pump power adjustment, there should be a brief period to monitor tank levels to ensure that they move towards desired levels and rectify the clogging anomaly effectively. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

OPERATE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 AT 1.0: INCREASING THE PUMP OUTPUTS FOR THESE TANKS ENSURES THEY CONTRIBUTE EFFICIENTLY TO THE FLOW, ASSISTING IN OVERCOMING ANY OBSTRUCTIONS CAUSED BY LOW FLOW RATES. 4. WAIT FOR A MONITORING PERIOD TO ASSESS TANK LEVELS: AFTER EXECUTING THESE VALVE CHANGES AND THE PUMP POWER ADJUSTMENT, THERE SHOULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD TO MONITOR TANK LEVELS TO ENSURE THAT THEY MOVE TOWARDS DESIRED LEVELS AND RECTIFY THE CLOGGING ANOMALY EFFECTIVELY. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0320275227796819m

  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0320275227796819m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 by setting it to 1.0 to allow flow from tank B203 to B204, addressing the issue flagged by the validation agent. 2. Increase the pump power by adjusting it to 1.0 (750W) to ensure sufficient flow rate to overcome the clogging anomaly detected by the monitoring agent. 3. Verify that valves valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 remain closed (0.0) as their respective tanks are at low levels and do not require any input flow. 4. Maintain valve_pump_tank_B204 at 0.5 to continue the flow from tank B204, monitoring this to ensure it does not overflow. 5. Lastly, ensure valve_out remains closed (0.0) until the tank levels stabilize and flow is verified. These actions should enable effective flow through the system. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

INCREASE THE PUMP POWER BY ADJUSTING IT TO 1.0 (750W) TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FLOW RATE TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY DETECTED BY THE MONITORING AGENT. 3. VERIFY THAT VALVES VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 REMAIN CLOSED (0.0) AS THEIR RESPECTIVE TANKS ARE AT LOW LEVELS AND DO NOT REQUIRE ANY INPUT FLOW. 4. MAINTAIN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 AT 0.5 TO CONTINUE THE FLOW FROM TANK B204, MONITORING THIS TO ENSURE IT DOES NOT OVERFLOW. 5. LASTLY, ENSURE VALVE_OUT REMAINS CLOSED (0.0) UNTIL THE TANK LEVELS STABILIZE AND FLOW IS VERIFIED. THESE ACTIONS SHOULD ENABLE EFFECTIVE FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 by setting it to 1.0 to allow flow from tank B203 to B204, addressing the issue flagged by the validation agent. 2. Increase the pump power by adjusting it to 1.0 (750W) to ensure sufficient flow rate to overcome the clogging anomaly detected by the monitoring agent. 3. Verify that valves valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 remain closed (0.0) as their respective tanks are at low levels and do not require any input flow. 4. Maintain valve_pump_tank_B204 at 0.5 to continue the flow from tank B204, monitoring this to ensure it does not overflow. 5. Lastly, ensure valve_out remains closed (0.0) until the tank levels stabilize and flow is verified. These actions should enable effective flow through the system. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 0 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204. This will allow tanks B201 and B204 to fill, and eliminate the clogging anomaly causing the flow obstruction. These valves must be open simultaneously to create adequate flow across the tanks and resolve the detected issue.\n\n2. Increase pump power to the maximum allowed (750W).

[2025-04-22 20:35:58][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: WHEN THE VALIDATION AGENT DETECTS THAT AN ACTION WAS NOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER), THIS AGENT RECEIVES THE FAULT CONTEXT AND CURRENT SYSTEM STATE.
THE GOAL IS TO ANALYZE WHAT WENT WRONG, AND DESIGN A STEP-BY-STEP CORRECTION PLAN.
**CURRENT STATE:**
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M

  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0
  - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.5 
  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
  - THE PUMP POWER IS 1.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.

**SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:**
  - VALVES B201, B202, B203 AND B204 ARE SOLENOID VALVES THAT IS ON OR OFF ONLY. 
  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  - THE PUMP IS SPEED-CONTROLLED VIA AN INPUT SHAFT SPEED N (RPM), WITH A NOMINAL SPEED OF 166.43 RPM. THE AGENT CAN VARY THE INPUT SPEED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FLOW.
  - THE PUMP FOLLOWS A QUADRATIC HEAD VS. FLOW RATE RELATIONSHIP. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE PUMP CAN DELIVER GREATER HEAD AND FLOW. THE FLOW DIRECTION IS FIXED DUE TO A BUILT-IN CHECK VALVE (NO FLOW REVERSAL ALLOWED). 
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS NOT OPEN OR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. EXACTLY 2 DESIRED VALVES ARE NOT OPEN. AND PUMP POWER IS LOW TO HANDLE CLOGGING ANAMOLY. THE MAX PUMP POWER OBSERVED IS 0 M3/S. THE PUMP POWER SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN 0.000105 M3/S. (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER).
- FAULT DETECTED BY MONITORING AGENT IS  (E.G., CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204).
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

**WHAT TO DO:** - ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND DETECTED FAULTS AND MANIPULATE THE ACUTATORS TO OVERCOME THE ISSUES.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** - LIST OF NEW VALVE/PUMP COMMANDS. - REASONING FOR EACH CHANGE. - CONFIRMATION THAT THIS PLAN SHOULD BE RETRIED BY THE PLANT OPERATOR AGENT.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204. This will allow tanks B201 and B204 to fill, and eliminate the clogging anomaly causing the flow obstruction. These valves must be open simultaneously to create adequate flow across the tanks and resolve the detected issue.

2. Increase pump power to the maximum allowed (750W). This will help overcome the clogging anomaly by increasing the flow rate and assist in moving any potential blockage through the system.

3. Monitor the levels of all tanks (B201, B202, B203, and B204) for a short duration after these changes. This ensures that the flow is re-established, and there‚Äôs no further obstruction detected.

4. If after monitoring, the flow is still observed at 0 m3/s, consider checking for other potential blockages or valve obstructions that might require manual inspection. This will help determine if there are additional issues needing addressing prior to resuming normal operations. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 0 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201. This allows flow from tank B201, assisting in leveling. 
2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204. This increases the discharge flow capacity and helps alleviate any pressure buildup due to clogging. 
3. Increase the pump power to 1 (750W). This will enhance the flow rate, helping to overcome any clogging anomalies in the system. 
4. Set valve_in0 and valve_in1 to 1 if applicable to ensure they are also contributing to the flow, if they are connected to the same line as B201 to B204.
5. Monitor the flow rate post-implementation to ensure it exceeds the required threshold of 0.000105 m3/s and confirm that no further obstructions are detected. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning Process:  
1. **Tank Levels**: Tank B201 and B202 are both at maximum levels (0.033m), tank B203 is at 0.029m, and tank B204 is at 0.022m. Therefore, we cannot fill B201 and B202.
2. **Current Valve States**: valve_in0 (filling valve for B201) and valve_in1 (filling valve for B202) are closed (0.0) as they should be since both tanks are already full. Valve_in2 remains at 1.0 since we are primarily focusing on tank B203.
3. **Pumping Status**: The pumping valves for the tanks B201, B202, and B203 are all closed (0.0), and only valve_pump_tank_B204 is partially open (0.5) to allow any mixed liquids to be emptied from B204.
4. Monitoring for clogging: The system shows no immediate faults or indications of a clogging anomaly, thus no adjustment to pump power or opening of additional valves is required.
5. **Actions Needed**: Given the current tank levels and valve positions, the system is stable, requiring no action at this moment. The levels have not reached conditions that warrant further adjustments. Thus, the state of the valves and pumps stays the same. 

The operational protocol is being followed correctly as per the task requirements.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 0 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

**CURRENT STATE:**
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340976549M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M 
  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0
  - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.5 
  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
  - THE PUMP POWER IS 750.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.

**SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:**
  - VALVES B201, B202, B203 AND B204 ARE SOLENOID VALVES THAT IS ON OR OFF ONLY. 
  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  - THE PUMP IS SPEED-CONTROLLED VIA AN INPUT SHAFT SPEED N (RPM), WITH A NOMINAL SPEED OF 166.43 RPM. THE AGENT CAN VARY THE INPUT SPEED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FLOW.
  - THE PUMP FOLLOWS A QUADRATIC HEAD VS. FLOW RATE RELATIONSHIP. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE PUMP CAN DELIVER GREATER HEAD AND FLOW. THE FLOW DIRECTION IS FIXED DUE TO A BUILT-IN CHECK VALVE (NO FLOW REVERSAL ALLOWED). 
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS NOT OPEN OR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. EXACTLY 2 DESIRED VALVES ARE NOT OPEN. AND PUMP POWER IS LOW TO HANDLE CLOGGING ANAMOLY. THE MAX PUMP POWER OBSERVED IS 0 M3/S. THE PUMP POWER SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN 0.000105 M3/S. (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER).
- FAULT DETECTED BY MONITORING AGENT IS  (E.G., CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204).
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

**WHAT TO DO:** - ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND DETECTED FAULTS AND MANIPULATE THE ACUTATORS TO OVERCOME THE ISSUES.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** - LIST OF NEW VALVE/PUMP COMMANDS. - REASONING FOR EACH CHANGE. - CONFIRMATION THAT THIS PLAN SHOULD BE RETRIED BY THE PLANT OPERATOR AGENT.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B201. Reasoning: This will enable the flow from tank B201 to the system, increasing the overall volume. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 (set to 1.0) to enhance the flow towards tank B204. Reasoning: This will facilitate the transfer of fluid to B204 and mitigate the clogging issue. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W). Reasoning: Raising the pump power will ensure adequate flow to overcome the suspected clogging anomaly. These actions collectively aim to remove any obstructions in the flow and stabilize the operations of the system. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.5  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B201. Reasoning: This will enable the flow from tank B201 to the system, increasing the overall volume. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 (set to 1.0) to enhance the flow towards tank B204. Reasoning: This will facilitate the transfer of fluid to B204 and mitigate the clogging issue. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W). Reasoning: Raising the pump power will ensure adequate flow to overcome the suspected clogging anomaly. These actions collectively aim to remove any obstructions in the flow and stabilize the operations of the system. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This allows fluid to flow into tank B202, which is essential as it is part of the system flow to tank B204. Given that this valve was flagged as closed, opening it will help to redirect flow correctly. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open: This valve is necessary to allow fluid to exit tank B204 into the next stage of the process. We have confirmation that it currently is open, so we will maintain its state. 3. Verify and maintain pump power at 1.0 (750W): The pump is currently operating at maximum power, which is appropriate to overcome any potential clogging anomaly that may hinder fluid flow. Keeping the pump at maximum power ensures that the system can generate enough pressure to push through any impediments. 4. Monitor the system after introducing these changes: Assess the levels in tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204 to ensure that they are stabilizing and that flow is reinstated without further interruptions.",

WE HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT IT CURRENTLY IS OPEN, SO WE WILL MAINTAIN ITS STATE. 3. VERIFY AND MAINTAIN PUMP POWER AT 1.0 (750W): THE PUMP IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT MAXIMUM POWER, WHICH IS APPROPRIATE TO OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY THAT MAY HINDER FLUID FLOW. KEEPING THE PUMP AT MAXIMUM POWER ENSURES THAT THE SYSTEM CAN GENERATE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO PUSH THROUGH ANY IMPEDIMENTS. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM AFTER INTRODUCING THESE CHANGES: ASSESS THE LEVELS IN TANKS B201, B202, B203, AND B204 TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE STABILIZING AND THAT FLOW IS REINSTATED WITHOUT FURTHER INTERRUPTIONS. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This allows fluid to flow into tank B202, which is essential as it is part of the system flow to tank B204. Given that this valve was flagged as closed, opening it will help to redirect flow correctly. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open: This valve is necessary to allow fluid to exit tank B204 into the next stage of the process. We have confirmation that it currently is open, so we will maintain its state. 3. Verify and maintain pump power at 1.0 (750W): The pump is currently operating at maximum power, which is appropriate to overcome any potential clogging anomaly that may hinder fluid flow. Keeping the pump at maximum power ensures that the system can generate enough pressure to push through any impediments. 4. Monitor the system after introducing these changes: Assess the levels in tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204 to ensure that they are stabilizing and that flow is reinstated without further interruptions. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 20:37:36][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 1.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THIS ALLOWS FLUID TO FLOW INTO TANK B202, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL AS IT IS PART OF THE SYSTEM FLOW TO TANK B204. GIVEN THAT THIS VALVE WAS FLAGGED AS CLOSED, OPENING IT WILL HELP TO REDIRECT FLOW CORRECTLY. 2. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN: THIS VALVE IS NECESSARY TO ALLOW FLUID TO EXIT TANK B204 INTO THE NEXT STAGE OF THE PROCESS. WE HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT IT CURRENTLY IS OPEN, SO WE WILL MAINTAIN ITS STATE. 3. VERIFY AND MAINTAIN PUMP POWER AT 1.0 (750W): THE PUMP IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT MAXIMUM POWER, WHICH IS APPROPRIATE TO OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY THAT MAY HINDER FLUID FLOW. KEEPING THE PUMP AT MAXIMUM POWER ENSURES THAT THE SYSTEM CAN GENERATE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO PUSH THROUGH ANY IMPEDIMENTS. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM AFTER INTRODUCING THESE CHANGES: ASSESS THE LEVELS IN TANKS B201, B202, B203, AND B204 TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE STABILIZING AND THAT FLOW IS REINSTATED WITHOUT FURTHER INTERRUPTIONS. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out

Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to ensure flow can properly exit and manage the tank levels. Since tank B204 is currently open, it is crucial to keep the flow consistent from both B202 and B204 towards the output to prevent obstruction and improve fluid dynamics. 3. Adjust pump power to 0.8 (600W) to increase flow without running the pump at maximum capacity, which helps maintain system integrity while increasing flow rates from both tanks (B201 and B202) into B204. This will also help mitigate the effects of potential clogging. 4.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow flow from tank B202. This addresses the immediate issue of the valve not being open as flagged by the validation agent. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to ensure flow can properly exit and manage the tank levels. Since tank B204 is currently open, it is crucial to keep the flow consistent from both B202 and B204 towards the output to prevent obstruction and improve fluid dynamics. 3. Adjust pump power to 0.8 (600W) to increase flow without running the pump at maximum capacity, which helps maintain system integrity while increasing flow rates from both tanks (B201 and B202) into B204. This will also help mitigate the effects of potential clogging. 4. Verify that valves_in0, valve_in1, and valve_in2 are set to the correct position to facilitate the expected flow direction and overcome any additional flow obstructions. 5. Monitor system pressures and tank levels continuously after these adjustments to ensure recovery and normalization of operation. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 2.928361113895028e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

THIS COMBINATION OF ACTIONS WILL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE CURRENT OPERATIONAL FAILURES AND RESTORE SYSTEM FUNCTION EFFICIENTLY. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.8 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** - Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to allow fluid flow from tank B201.
- Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to facilitate connection to tank B204.
- Increase pump power to 1.0 to ensure adequate flow rate to overcome the clogging anomaly.

Reasoning: The validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204 were not open. This restricts the flow required for operations, particularly in the presence of a clogging anomaly. By opening both valves, we enhance the flow path and promote the movement of fluid through the system, aiding in clearing any blockages. Furthermore, increasing the pump power to maximum (750W) is crucial to provide sufficient energy to overcome the clog and maintain an acceptable flow rate above the detected anomaly threshold of 0.000105 m3/s. This combination of actions will effectively address the current operational failures and restore system function efficiently. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning: The current levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 are at their maximum capacity of 0.033m. Upon this condition, valve_in0, valve_in1, and valve_in2 status indicated existing fill methods are not to be engaged yet (0.0, 0.0, and 1.0 respectively). The operational goal here is to now fully empty liquid from tank B201 to tank B204, hence valve_pump_tank_B201 should be opened to facilitate this transfer.

Since tank B202's pumping is already open as indicated (1.0), during the emptying of B201, the focus should also include ensuring valve_pump_tank_B204 remains engaged (1.0) as it is critical for maintaining the flow-to-mix process.

Having noted upon the suggestion to address potential clogging issues, the pump power will be increased to its maximum setting (1.0 or 750W), ensuring adequate force to override any possible blockage in the fluid path, affirming that operational capacities will be returned to standard.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441311384465131m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** - Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to allow fluid flow from tank B201.
- Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to facilitate connection to tank B204.
- Increase pump power to 1.0 to ensure adequate flow rate to overcome the clogging anomaly.

Reasoning: The validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204 were not open. This restricts the flow required for operations, particularly in the presence of a clogging anomaly. By opening both valves, we enhance the flow path and promote the movement of fluid through the system, aiding in clearing any blockages. Furthermore, increasing the pump power to maximum (750W) is crucial to provide sufficient energy to overcome the clog and maintain an acceptable flow rate above the detected anomaly threshold of 0.000105 m3/s. This combination of actions will effectively address the current operational failures and restore system function efficiently. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 20:39:23][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0441311384465131M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 1.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** - OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO ALLOW FLUID FLOW FROM TANK B201.
- OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO FACILITATE CONNECTION TO TANK B204.
- INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 TO ENSURE ADEQUATE FLOW RATE TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY.

REASONING: THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 WERE NOT OPEN. THIS RESTRICTS THE FLOW REQUIRED FOR OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE PRESENCE OF A CLOGGING ANOMALY. BY OPENING BOTH VALVES, WE ENHANCE THE FLOW PATH AND PROMOTE THE MOVEMENT OF FLUID THROUGH THE SYSTEM, AIDING IN CLEARING ANY BLOCKAGES. FURTHERMORE, INCREASING THE PUMP POWER TO MAXIMUM (750W) IS CRUCIAL TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ENERGY TO OVERCOME THE CLOG AND MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE FLOW RATE ABOVE THE DETECTED ANOMALY THRESHOLD OF 0.000105 M3/S. THIS COMBINATION OF ACTIONS WILL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE CURRENT OPERATIONAL FAILURES AND RESTORE SYSTEM FUNCTION EFFICIENTLY. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m

  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 2.51002381190985e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently closed, and based on the fault detected, having this valve open is crucial for allowing the flow from tank B202 towards tank B204. This change will ensure tank B202 contributes to the flow needed to prevent the clogging anomaly observed. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve is also crucial for maintaining the operational flow in the system. Since it is currently marked as not open, must be rectified to allow flow from tank B204 onwards. 3. Increase pump power to 300W: The current pump power is insufficient to handle the observed clogging anomaly. Raising the power will enhance the pump's ability to overcome the flow restrictions caused by the clog and ensure effective transfer of liquids between the tanks. Overall, these adjustments will collectively address the fault conditions flagged by the validation agent and restore normal operational flow across the system.",

OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THIS VALVE IS ALSO CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE OPERATIONAL FLOW IN THE SYSTEM. SINCE IT IS CURRENTLY MARKED AS NOT OPEN, MUST BE RECTIFIED TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B204 ONWARDS. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 300W: THE CURRENT PUMP POWER IS INSUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE OBSERVED CLOGGING ANOMALY. RAISING THE POWER WILL ENHANCE THE PUMP'S ABILITY TO OVERCOME THE FLOW RESTRICTIONS CAUSED BY THE CLOG AND ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDS BETWEEN THE TANKS.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441311384465131m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently closed, and based on the fault detected, having this valve open is crucial for allowing the flow from tank B202 towards tank B204. This change will ensure tank B202 contributes to the flow needed to prevent the clogging anomaly observed. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve is also crucial for maintaining the operational flow in the system. Since it is currently marked as not open, must be rectified to allow flow from tank B204 onwards. 3. Increase pump power to 300W: The current pump power is insufficient to handle the observed clogging anomaly. Raising the power will enhance the pump's ability to overcome the flow restrictions caused by the clog and ensure effective transfer of liquids between the tanks. Overall, these adjustments will collectively address the fault conditions flagged by the validation agent and restore normal operational flow across the system. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 300.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 2.51002381190985e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 (set to 1.0): This valve is currently closed, which is preventing any flow from tank B202 into the system. Since the validation agent flagged this valve as not open, it is critical to open it to allow the transfer of liquid from tank B202. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 (set to 1.0): Similar to valve_pump_tank_B202, this valve must be opened to facilitate flow from tank B204. If this valve is not opened, it will hinder the overall flow through the system. 3. Increase pump power to maximum (set to 750W): The current pump power is insufficient to handle the clogging anomaly detected by the monitoring agent. Increasing the pump power will enable more robust flow and help alleviate any obstruction within the system. By ensuring that both tank B202 and tank B204 are appropriately accessed and maximizing pump output, the system can overcome the current clogging issue.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441311384465131m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 300.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 (set to 1.0): This valve is currently closed, which is preventing any flow from tank B202 into the system. Since the validation agent flagged this valve as not open, it is critical to open it to allow the transfer of liquid from tank B202. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 (set to 1.0): Similar to valve_pump_tank_B202, this valve must be opened to facilitate flow from tank B204. If this valve is not opened, it will hinder the overall flow through the system. 3. Increase pump power to maximum (set to 750W): The current pump power is insufficient to handle the clogging anomaly detected by the monitoring agent. Increasing the pump power will enable more robust flow and help alleviate any obstruction within the system. By ensuring that both tank B202 and tank B204 are appropriately accessed and maximizing pump output, the system can overcome the current clogging issue. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0441311384465131M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 300.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 (SET TO 1.0): THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING ANY FLOW FROM TANK B202 INTO THE SYSTEM. SINCE THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THIS VALVE AS NOT OPEN, IT IS CRITICAL TO OPEN IT TO ALLOW THE TRANSFER OF LIQUID FROM TANK B202. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 (SET TO 1.0): SIMILAR TO VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, THIS VALVE MUST BE OPENED TO FACILITATE FLOW FROM TANK B204. IF THIS VALVE IS NOT OPENED, IT WILL HINDER THE OVERALL FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO MAXIMUM (SET TO 750W): THE CURRENT PUMP POWER IS INSUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE CLOGGING ANOMALY DETECTED BY THE MONITORING AGENT. INCREASING THE PUMP POWER WILL ENABLE MORE ROBUST FLOW AND HELP ALLEVIATE ANY OBSTRUCTION WITHIN THE SYSTEM. BY ENSURING THAT BOTH TANK B202 AND TANK B204 ARE APPROPRIATELY ACCESSED AND MAXIMIZING PUMP OUTPUT, THE SYSTEM CAN OVERCOME THE CURRENT CLOGGING ISSUE. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 2.51002381190985e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441311384465131m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 (set to 1.0) to ensure the tank B202 is accessible for filling and expelling fluid, thereby stabilizing the tank levels.
2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open (already set to 1.0) to maintain an efficient flow out from tank B204 and avoid back pressure.
3. Adjust pump power to 1.0 (750W) to provide the necessary force to overcome the identified clogging anomaly in the line and ensure sufficient flow transport across the tanks.
4. Validate all valves post-command execution to ensure that valve statuses reflect correctly. 
5. Monitor the system response after these actions to confirm the recovery from the clogging anomaly and ensure normal operation resumes. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441395622495697m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 (set to 1.0) to ensure the tank B202 is accessible for filling and expelling fluid, thereby stabilizing the tank levels.
2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open (already set to 1.0) to maintain an efficient flow out from tank B204 and avoid back pressure.
3. Adjust pump power to 1.0 (750W) to provide the necessary force to overcome the identified clogging anomaly in the line and ensure sufficient flow transport across the tanks.
4. Validate all valves post-command execution to ensure that valve statuses reflect correctly. 
5. Monitor the system response after these actions to confirm the recovery from the clogging anomaly and ensure normal operation resumes. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m

  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 2.091686509924921e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441395622495697m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 (set to 1.0). This is necessary as the validation agent flagged that this valve is currently closed, and it needs to be opened to allow the proper flow of fluid from tank B202.\n2. Increase pump power to a level above 0.000105 m3/s. Adjust the pump power to 1.0 (max power of 750W). This adjustment is crucial to overcome the detected clogging anomaly and to ensure adequate flow is generated to clear any obstructions that might be present in the system.\n3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open (maintain at 1.0). This valve is correctly positioned and needs to remain open to facilitate the outflow from tank B204 to the downstream process.\n4. Lastly, monitor the flow rates after these adjustments to confirm the system recovers from the clogging anomaly and operates within expected parameters. Additionally, after making these changes, instructions should advise the plant operator to retry the operation once adjustments are confirmed.\n **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.

  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0441395622495697M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 750.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 (SET TO 1.0). THIS IS NECESSARY AS THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, AND IT NEEDS TO BE OPENED TO ALLOW THE PROPER FLOW OF FLUID FROM TANK B202.\N2. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO A LEVEL ABOVE 0.000105 M3/S. ADJUST THE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (MAX POWER OF 750W). THIS ADJUSTMENT IS CRUCIAL TO OVERCOME THE DETECTED CLOGGING ANOMALY AND TO ENSURE ADEQUATE FLOW IS GENERATED TO CLEAR ANY OBSTRUCTIONS THAT MIGHT BE PRESENT IN THE SYSTEM.\N3. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN (MAINTAIN AT 1.0). THIS VALVE IS CORRECTLY POSITIONED AND NEEDS TO REMAIN OPEN TO FACILITATE THE OUTFLOW FROM TANK B204 TO THE DOWNSTREAM PROCESS.\N4. LASTLY, MONITOR THE FLOW RATES AFTER THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO CONFIRM THE SYSTEM RECOVERS FROM THE CLOGGING ANOMALY AND OPERATES WITHIN EXPECTED PARAMETERS. ADDITIONALLY, AFTER MAKING THESE CHANGES, INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD ADVISE THE PLANT OPERATOR TO RETRY THE OPERATION ONCE ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONFIRMED.\N **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m

  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This will allow flow from tank B203, which is crucial since it is currently not open and is preventing proper flow operations. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Similar to B203, opening this valve ensures that any potential flow to the tank is initiated for desired operational intent. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W): This will maximize the pump's flow rate capabilities and help overcome any potential flow obstruction due to insufficient pressure. 4.

OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: SIMILAR TO B203, OPENING THIS VALVE ENSURES THAT ANY POTENTIAL FLOW TO THE TANK IS INITIATED FOR DESIRED OPERATIONAL INTENT. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (750W): THIS WILL MAXIMIZE THE PUMP'S FLOW RATE CAPABILITIES AND HELP OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL FLOW OBSTRUCTION DUE TO INSUFFICIENT PRESSURE. 4. MONITOR THE FLOW RATES AND LEVELS IN TANKS B201, B202, B203, AND B204 AFTER ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE DESIRED LEVELS ARE REACHED AND MAINTAINED. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441395622495697m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This will allow flow from tank B203, which is crucial since it is currently not open and is preventing proper flow operations. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Similar to B203, opening this valve ensures that any potential flow to the tank is initiated for desired operational intent. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W): This will maximize the pump's flow rate capabilities and help overcome any potential flow obstruction due to insufficient pressure. 4. Monitor the flow rates and levels in tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204 after adjustments to ensure desired levels are reached and maintained. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning Process:  
1. **Tank Levels Check**: The current states of the tanks are B201 (0.0219999998977998m), B202 (0.0219999998977998m), B203 (0.0330000001033m), and B204 (0.0441395622495697m). As B201 and B202 are at the minimum level, we must first empty the tanks before filling any.  
2. **Valves Status**: The filling valves (valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2) are operated based on the maximum fill capacity. However, since B201 and B202 are at their minimum, we are currently not filling any tanks.  
3. **Pump Operations**: All pumping valves are operational, pumping liquid from B201 (1.0), B202 (1.0), B203 (1.0) into B204 (1.0) while B204 is also receiving fluid.  
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Given the system indicates potential clogging and requires flow adjustments, we would benefit from manipulating the pump power. Increasing pump power up to 1.0 (750W) allows for better flow management and helps counter any discrepancies in the system caused by the clog.  
5. **No Immediate Actions to Close Anything**: As nothing requires closing or filling at this moment since we are transferring from B201, B202, and B203 into B204 while having the pump initiated already.  

Thus all operational states and actions have been maintained correctly for immediate liquid handling.[00m

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0441395622495697m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: Reasoning - This valve is reported as closed, and as a result, it is preventing flow from tank B203 which is crucial for maintaining the operating conditions. Opening this valve allows flow to proceed to tank B204.

2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Reasoning - Similar to B203, this valve being closed is obstructing the discharge flow to the next stage. By opening this valve, we will facilitate necessary flow out from the tank.

3. Reduce pump power to 600W: Reasoning - The current pump power is set to the maximum of 750W, which could exacerbate any obstruction if present. Reducing the power will help in maintaining a safer operational state while we address the valves and ensures the system operates within its design parameters until operational integrity is restored.

4. Adjust pump speed to a lower rate (around 150 rpm): Reasoning - Reducing the pump speed will decrease the pressure and help minimize any stress on the system that could be caused by potential clogs, providing a safer operational condition while we work on resolving the valve issues. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning Process:  
1. **Current State of Tanks:**
   - B201: 0.0219999998977998m (near minimum)
   - B202: 0.0219999998977998m (near minimum)
   - B203: 0.0330000001033m (full)
   - B204: 0.0441395622495697m

2. **Valves:**
   - valve_in0 (closed) is correct as B201 and B202 are not full.
   - valve_in1 (open) filling B202 is correct as B202 is not full.
   - valve_in2 (closed) is correct as B203 is full.
   - valve_pump_tank_B201 (closed): Since B201 is at minimum, this should be closed.
   - valve_pump_tank_B202 (open): This should be kept open to transfer contents from B202 to B204.
   - valve_pump_tank_B203 (open): This should be kept open to allow any leftover liquid from B203 into B204. 
   - valve_pump_tank_B204 (open): This should remain open to facilitate the mixing.
   - valve_out (closed) should remain closed until B204 is filled to minimum, which it currently is not.

3. **Pump Power:**
   - The current pump power is set to 750W, which is excessive given the clogging fault detected. Power is reduced to 600W to alleviate potential pressure caused by clogs in the line.

Actions Taken:
- Closed valve_pump_tank_B201 as there is no liquid to transfer from it.
- Kept valve_pump_tank_B202 and valve_pump_tank_B203 open to facilitate the flow of liquids to B204.
- Lowered the pump power to 600W to prevent stress on the system for safety reasons.
- No changes were made to valve_out as B204 does not need to be emptied yet.

The system has been adjusted to ensure safe operational limits, and the mixing process can continue unhindered.[00m

  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0441395622495697M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 750.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203: REASONING - THIS VALVE IS REPORTED AS CLOSED, AND AS A RESULT, IT IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B203 WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR MAINTAINING THE OPERATING CONDITIONS. OPENING THIS VALVE ALLOWS FLOW TO PROCEED TO TANK B204.

2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: REASONING - SIMILAR TO B203, THIS VALVE BEING CLOSED IS OBSTRUCTING THE DISCHARGE FLOW TO THE NEXT STAGE. BY OPENING THIS VALVE, WE WILL FACILITATE NECESSARY FLOW OUT FROM THE TANK.

3. REDUCE PUMP POWER TO 600W: REASONING - THE CURRENT PUMP POWER IS SET TO THE MAXIMUM OF 750W, WHICH COULD EXACERBATE ANY OBSTRUCTION IF PRESENT. REDUCING THE POWER WILL HELP IN MAINTAINING A SAFER OPERATIONAL STATE WHILE WE ADDRESS THE VALVES AND ENSURES THE SYSTEM OPERATES WITHIN ITS DESIGN PARAMETERS UNTIL OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY IS RESTORED.

4. ADJUST PUMP SPEED TO A LOWER RATE (AROUND 150 RPM): REASONING - REDUCING THE PUMP SPEED WILL DECREASE THE PRESSURE AND HELP MINIMIZE ANY STRESS ON THE SYSTEM THAT COULD BE CAUSED BY POTENTIAL CLOGS, PROVIDING A SAFER OPERATIONAL CONDITION WHILE WE WORK ON RESOLVING THE VALVE ISSUES. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.
