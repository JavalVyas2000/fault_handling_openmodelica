[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  "pump_power": 0.0
}  

Reasoning:  
- The current levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203 are all at their minimum of 0.022m.  
- According to the operational procedure, I can open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to its maximum of 0.033m since both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels.  
- Therefore, the action required is to keep **valve_in0** open while all other valves remain closed, as no further actions can be taken until B201 reaches its maximum capacity.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

Reasoning:  
- The current level of tank B201 is 0.029m, which is below the maximum limit of 0.033m.  
- The levels in both tank B202 and tank B203 are at their minimum of 0.022m.  
- Therefore, I will keep **valve_in0** open to continue filling tank B201 until it reaches its maximum capacity.  
- No other actions are required at this moment as the other valves remain closed and the tanks are not yet ready for emptying.[00m

[2025-04-23 22:05:53][üìã TASK STARTED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  "valve_pump_tank_B204": 0.0,
  "pump_power": 0.0
}  

Reasoning Process:  
1. The current level of tank B201 is at its maximum capacity of 0.033m, so I will close **valve_in0**.  
2. The levels in tanks B202 and B203 are both at their minimum of 0.022m, allowing me to proceed to fill tank B202. Therefore, I will open **valve_in1** to fill tank B202 to its maximum of 0.033m.  
3. The other valves remain unchanged as we are currently in the process of filling tank B202.  

This ensures that the operations are within the safe operating limits of the plant.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

}  

Reasoning:  
1. The level of tank B201 is at its maximum (0.033m), so we do not need to open valve_in0.  
2. The level of tank B202 is currently at 0.029m, which is below its maximum capacity (0.033m), and tank B203 is at its minimum (0.022m). Therefore, we can proceed to fill tank B202.  
3. Valve_in1 is already open, indicating that we are currently filling tank B202.  
4. No other actions are required at this moment as we are waiting for tank B202 to reach its maximum capacity before proceeding to the next steps.  
5. All other valves remain closed as we are still in the filling phase for tank B202.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

}  

Reasoning:  
- The current levels of tanks B201 and B202 are at their maximum capacity of 0.033m, while tank B203 is at its minimum level of 0.022m.  
- According to the operational procedure, since B201 is full, we need to close valve_in0 and open valve_in1 to fill tank B202. However, valve_in1 is already open, indicating that tank B202 is currently being filled.  
- No further actions are required at this moment as the procedure dictates to wait until tank B202 reaches its maximum capacity before proceeding to fill tank B203.  
- Therefore, the state of the valves remains unchanged.[00m

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in1 to stop filling tank B202. Reason: Tank B202 is already full, and we need to prevent overflow. 2. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203. Reason: We need to ensure that tank B203 is filled to its maximum capacity of 0.033m to proceed with the mixing process. 3. Increase pump power to 750W for valve_pump_tank_B204. Reason: This will ensure that the liquid can be effectively transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204 despite the detected clogging issue. 4. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to tank B204. Reason: This is the next step in the sequence to ensure that the mixing process continues. 5. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 closely to ensure they do not drop below the minimum level of 0.021m before proceeding to the next tank. Reason: This is crucial to maintain the operational integrity of the system and ensure that all tanks are emptied correctly. 6. Once tank B201 reaches the minimum level, close valve_pump_tank_B201 and open valve_pump_tank_B202 to transfer liquid from tank B202 to tank B204. Reason: This follows the operational sequence and ensures that all liquids are mixed in tank B204. 7. Repeat the process for tank B203 once tank B202 is emptied. Reason: This ensures that all tanks are utilized effectively for the mixing process. 8. Finally, once all tanks are emptied, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from tank B204. Reason: This completes the operation and ensures that the mixed liquid is removed from the system.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 TO STOP FILLING TANK B202. REASON: TANK B202 IS ALREADY FULL, AND WE NEED TO PREVENT OVERFLOW. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO FILL TANK B203. REASON: WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT TANK B203 IS FILLED TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M TO PROCEED WITH THE MIXING PROCESS. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 750W FOR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204. REASON: THIS WILL ENSURE THAT THE LIQUID CAN BE EFFECTIVELY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204 DESPITE THE DETECTED CLOGGING ISSUE. 4. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO START TRANSFERRING LIQUID FROM TANK B201 TO TANK B204. REASON: THIS IS THE NEXT STEP IN THE SEQUENCE TO ENSURE THAT THE MIXING PROCESS CONTINUES. 5. MONITOR THE LEVELS IN TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 CLOSELY TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT DROP BELOW THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF 0.021M BEFORE PROCEEDING TO THE NEXT TANK. REASON: THIS IS CRUCIAL TO MAINTAIN THE OPERATIONAL INTEGRITY OF THE SYSTEM AND ENSURE THAT ALL TANKS ARE EMPTIED CORRECTLY. 6. ONCE TANK B201 REACHES THE MINIMUM LEVEL, CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM TANK B202 TO TANK B204. REASON: THIS FOLLOWS THE OPERATIONAL SEQUENCE AND ENSURES THAT ALL LIQUIDS ARE MIXED IN TANK B204. 7. REPEAT THE PROCESS FOR TANK B203 ONCE TANK B202 IS EMPTIED. REASON: THIS ENSURES THAT ALL TANKS ARE UTILIZED EFFECTIVELY FOR THE MIXING PROCESS. 8. FINALLY, ONCE ALL TANKS ARE EMPTIED, OPEN VALVE_OUT TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM TANK B204. REASON: THIS COMPLETES THE OPERATION AND ENSURES THAT THE MIXED LIQUID IS REMOVED FROM THE SYSTEM.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0

  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to halt any ongoing transfers from the tanks to B204. 3. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, as both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 4. Once B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and open valve_in1 to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 5. After B202 is filled, close valve_in1 and open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 6. Monitor the system for any further clogging issues and ensure that all valves are functioning correctly. 7. Once all tanks are filled, proceed to empty them into B204 as per the original sequence, ensuring to check for any obstructions before each transfer. 8. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure maximum efficiency during the transfer process. 9. After all tanks are emptied into B204, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204 until it reaches a minimum level between 0.021m and 0.022m.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to halt any ongoing transfers from the tanks to B204. 3. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, as both B202 and B203 are at their minimum levels. 4. Once B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and open valve_in1 to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 5. After B202 is filled, close valve_in1 and open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 6. Monitor the system for any further clogging issues and ensure that all valves are functioning correctly. 7. Once all tanks are filled, proceed to empty them into B204 as per the original sequence, ensuring to check for any obstructions before each transfer. 8. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure maximum efficiency during the transfer process. 9. After all tanks are emptied into B204, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204 until it reaches a minimum level between 0.021m and 0.022m.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

    - **Output Valve:** valve_out

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to halt any liquid transfer from the tanks to B204. This will ensure that no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. This is to prepare for a potential flushing operation. 4. Once tank B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer the liquid from B201 to B204. This will help in flushing out the clog. 5. Monitor the flow and pressure to determine if the clog is cleared. If the flow resumes normally, proceed with the operation. If not, further investigation may be required. 6. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow capacity during the flushing process. This will help in overcoming any resistance caused by the clog. 7. After the flushing operation, check the status of valve_in2 and ensure it is open. If it is not, manually open it to allow for proper filling of tank B203. 8. Once the clog is cleared and all tanks are at the required levels, resume the normal operation sequence as per the original control sequence.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to effectively address the clogging issue and resume normal operations."

THIS WILL HELP IN OVERCOMING ANY RESISTANCE CAUSED BY THE CLOG. 7. AFTER THE FLUSHING OPERATION, CHECK THE STATUS OF VALVE_IN2 AND ENSURE IT IS OPEN. IF IT IS NOT, MANUALLY OPEN IT TO ALLOW FOR PROPER FILLING OF TANK B203. 8. ONCE THE CLOG IS CLEARED AND ALL TANKS ARE AT THE REQUIRED LEVELS, RESUME THE NORMAL OPERATION SEQUENCE AS PER THE ORIGINAL CONTROL SEQUENCE.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to halt any liquid transfer from the tanks to B204. This will ensure that no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. This is to prepare for a potential flushing operation. 4. Once tank B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer the liquid from B201 to B204. This will help in flushing out the clog. 5. Monitor the flow and pressure to determine if the clog is cleared. If the flow resumes normally, proceed with the operation. If not, further investigation may be required. 6. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow capacity during the flushing process. This will help in overcoming any resistance caused by the clog. 7. After the flushing operation, check the status of valve_in2 and ensure it is open. If it is not, manually open it to allow for proper filling of tank B203. 8. Once the clog is cleared and all tanks are at the required levels, resume the normal operation sequence as per the original control sequence.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to halt any liquid transfer from the tanks to B204. This will ensure that no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. This is to prepare for a potential flushing operation. 4. Once tank B201 is filled, close valve_in0 and open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer the liquid from B201 to B204. This will help in flushing out the clog. 5. Monitor the flow and pressure to determine if the clog is cleared. If the flow resumes normally, proceed with the operation. If not, further investigation may be required. 6. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow capacity during the flushing process. This will help in overcoming any resistance caused by the clog. 7. After the flushing operation, check the status of valve_in2 and ensure it is open. If it is not, manually open it to allow for proper filling of tank B203. 8. Once the clog is cleared and all tanks are at the required levels, resume the normal operation sequence as per the original control sequence.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.
  - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
    - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
    - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
    - **Output Valve:** valve_out

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 750.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in2 to ensure no further liquid is being drawn from tank B203, as it is currently open and may be contributing to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer liquid from tank B201 to tank B204, as it is currently full and can be emptied. 3. Adjust the pump power for valve_pump_tank_B204 to 500W to ensure effective transfer of liquid from B201 to B204 without overwhelming the system. 4. Monitor the levels in tank B204 and the status of the valves to ensure that the clogging issue is resolved before proceeding with the next steps. 5. Once the liquid from B201 is sufficiently transferred, close valve_pump_tank_B201 and then open valve_pump_tank_B202 to transfer liquid from tank B202 to tank B204. 6. Finally, once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204. This step-by-step approach will help in managing the clogging issue while ensuring that the mixing process continues effectively.",

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN2 TO ENSURE NO FURTHER LIQUID IS BEING DRAWN FROM TANK B203, AS IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM TANK B201 TO TANK B204, AS IT IS CURRENTLY FULL AND CAN BE EMPTIED. 3. ADJUST THE PUMP POWER FOR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO 500W TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF LIQUID FROM B201 TO B204 WITHOUT OVERWHELMING THE SYSTEM. 4. MONITOR THE LEVELS IN TANK B204 AND THE STATUS OF THE VALVES TO ENSURE THAT THE CLOGGING ISSUE IS RESOLVED BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE NEXT STEPS. 5. ONCE THE LIQUID FROM B201 IS SUFFICIENTLY TRANSFERRED, CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 AND THEN OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM TANK B202 TO TANK B204. 6.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in2 to ensure no further liquid is being drawn from tank B203, as it is currently open and may be contributing to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer liquid from tank B201 to tank B204, as it is currently full and can be emptied. 3. Adjust the pump power for valve_pump_tank_B204 to 500W to ensure effective transfer of liquid from B201 to B204 without overwhelming the system. 4. Monitor the levels in tank B204 and the status of the valves to ensure that the clogging issue is resolved before proceeding with the next steps. 5. Once the liquid from B201 is sufficiently transferred, close valve_pump_tank_B201 and then open valve_pump_tank_B202 to transfer liquid from tank B202 to tank B204. 6. Finally, once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204. This step-by-step approach will help in managing the clogging issue while ensuring that the mixing process continues effectively.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in2 to stop any flow from tank B203. This is necessary because the validation agent flagged that valve_in2 is not open, indicating a potential issue with the flow from B203. 2. Open valve_in0 to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m, as both tank B202 and tank B203 are at their minimum levels. 3. Once tank B201 reaches its maximum level, close valve_in0 and open valve_in1 to fill tank B202 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 4. After tank B202 is full, close valve_in1 and open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. 5. Monitor the system for any further clogging issues and ensure that the pump power remains at 500W to maintain adequate flow. 6. Once all tanks are filled, proceed with the normal sequence of emptying tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204, ensuring that the pump valves are opened sequentially as per the original control sequence. 7. Finally, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from tank B204 once all tanks have been emptied to the minimum level.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340976549M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN2 TO STOP ANY FLOW FROM TANK B203. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_IN2 IS NOT OPEN, INDICATING A POTENTIAL ISSUE WITH THE FLOW FROM B203. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO FILL TANK B201 TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M, AS BOTH TANK B202 AND TANK B203 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM LEVELS. 3. ONCE TANK B201 REACHES ITS MAXIMUM LEVEL, CLOSE VALVE_IN0 AND OPEN VALVE_IN1 TO FILL TANK B202 TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M. 4. AFTER TANK B202 IS FULL, CLOSE VALVE_IN1 AND OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO FILL TANK B203 TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M. 5. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY FURTHER CLOGGING ISSUES AND ENSURE THAT THE PUMP POWER REMAINS AT 500W TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE FLOW. 6. ONCE ALL TANKS ARE FILLED, PROCEED WITH THE NORMAL SEQUENCE OF EMPTYING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204, ENSURING THAT THE PUMP VALVES ARE OPENED SEQUENTIALLY AS PER THE ORIGINAL CONTROL SEQUENCE. 7. FINALLY, OPEN VALVE_OUT TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM TANK B204 ONCE ALL TANKS HAVE BEEN EMPTIED TO THE MINIMUM LEVEL.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.

    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 1.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0

  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 500.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to stop filling tank B201. Reason: Tank B201 is already at maximum capacity, and we need to prevent overflow. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently closed) to ensure no liquid is being filled into tank B202. Reason: We need to stabilize the system before proceeding. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. Reason: Tank B203 is currently at 0.029m, and we need to fill it to ensure all tanks are ready for emptying. 4. Check for any clogging in the lines connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. If clogging is detected, initiate a cleaning procedure or adjust the flow to clear the obstruction. 5. Once tank B203 is filled, open valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill tank B204. Reason: This is necessary to start the mixing process. 6. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. Reason: This is the next step in the control sequence. 7. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 closely to ensure they reach the minimum level before closing the respective pump valves. 8. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure optimal flow rates during the transfer process. Reason: The current pump power is insufficient for effective operation. 9. Once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204. Reason: This is the final step to complete the operation.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to stop filling tank B201. Reason: Tank B201 is already at maximum capacity, and we need to prevent overflow. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently closed) to ensure no liquid is being filled into tank B202. Reason: We need to stabilize the system before proceeding. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. Reason: Tank B203 is currently at 0.029m, and we need to fill it to ensure all tanks are ready for emptying. 4. Check for any clogging in the lines connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. If clogging is detected, initiate a cleaning procedure or adjust the flow to clear the obstruction. 5. Once tank B203 is filled, open valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill tank B204. Reason: This is necessary to start the mixing process. 6. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. Reason: This is the next step in the control sequence. 7. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 closely to ensure they reach the minimum level before closing the respective pump valves. 8. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure optimal flow rates during the transfer process. Reason: The current pump power is insufficient for effective operation. 9. Once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204. Reason: This is the final step to complete the operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in0 (currently open) to stop filling tank B201. Reason: Tank B201 is already at maximum capacity, and we need to prevent overflow. 2. Close valve_in1 (currently closed) to ensure no liquid is being filled into tank B202. Reason: We need to stabilize the system before proceeding. 3. Open valve_in2 to fill tank B203 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. Reason: Tank B203 is currently at 0.029m, and we need to fill it to ensure all tanks are ready for emptying. 4. Check for any clogging in the lines connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. If clogging is detected, initiate a cleaning procedure or adjust the flow to clear the obstruction. 5. Once tank B203 is filled, open valve_pump_tank_B204 to fill tank B204. Reason: This is necessary to start the mixing process. 6. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to transfer liquid from B201 to B204. Reason: This is the next step in the control sequence. 7. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, and B203 closely to ensure they reach the minimum level before closing the respective pump valves. 8. Adjust pump power to 750W to ensure optimal flow rates during the transfer process. Reason: The current pump power is insufficient for effective operation. 9. Once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204. Reason: This is the final step to complete the operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 (CURRENTLY OPEN) TO STOP FILLING TANK B201. REASON: TANK B201 IS ALREADY AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY, AND WE NEED TO PREVENT OVERFLOW. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 (CURRENTLY CLOSED) TO ENSURE NO LIQUID IS BEING FILLED INTO TANK B202. REASON: WE NEED TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM BEFORE PROCEEDING. 3. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO FILL TANK B203 TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF 0.033M. REASON: TANK B203 IS CURRENTLY AT 0.029M, AND WE NEED TO FILL IT TO ENSURE ALL TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 4. CHECK FOR ANY CLOGGING IN THE LINES CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204. IF CLOGGING IS DETECTED, INITIATE A CLEANING PROCEDURE OR ADJUST THE FLOW TO CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION. 5. ONCE TANK B203 IS FILLED, OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO FILL TANK B204. REASON: THIS IS NECESSARY TO START THE MIXING PROCESS. 6. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM B201 TO B204. REASON: THIS IS THE NEXT STEP IN THE CONTROL SEQUENCE. 7. MONITOR THE LEVELS IN TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 CLOSELY TO ENSURE THEY REACH THE MINIMUM LEVEL BEFORE CLOSING THE RESPECTIVE PUMP VALVES. 8. ADJUST PUMP POWER TO 750W TO ENSURE OPTIMAL FLOW RATES DURING THE TRANSFER PROCESS. REASON: THE CURRENT PUMP POWER IS INSUFFICIENT FOR EFFECTIVE OPERATION. 9. ONCE ALL TANKS ARE EMPTIED TO THE MINIMUM LEVEL, OPEN VALVE_OUT TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM B204. REASON: THIS IS THE FINAL STEP TO COMPLETE THE OPERATION.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the flow from B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications while addressing the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to halt the transfer from B201 to B204, ensuring no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow any potential backflow or pressure relief from B202, which may help in clearing the clog. 4. Adjust the pump power to 500W to provide sufficient force to assist in clearing the clog without overwhelming the system. 5. Monitor the system for any changes in pressure or flow rates to assess if the clog is being cleared. 6. Once the clog is cleared, close valve_pump_tank_B202 and reopen valve_pump_tank_B204 to resume normal operations. 7. After confirming that all tanks are at the desired levels, proceed with the mixing and emptying sequence as per the original control sequence.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the flow from B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications while addressing the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to halt the transfer from B201 to B204, ensuring no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow any potential backflow or pressure relief from B202, which may help in clearing the clog. 4. Adjust the pump power to 500W to provide sufficient force to assist in clearing the clog without overwhelming the system. 5. Monitor the system for any changes in pressure or flow rates to assess if the clog is being cleared. 6. Once the clog is cleared, close valve_pump_tank_B202 and reopen valve_pump_tank_B204 to resume normal operations. 7. After confirming that all tanks are at the desired levels, proceed with the mixing and emptying sequence as per the original control sequence.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to halt the transfer from tank B201 to B204, as it is already at its minimum level. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow the liquid from tank B202 to flow into tank B204, which may help in clearing the clogging issue. 4. Adjust the pump power for valve_pump_tank_B202 to 750W to ensure maximum flow rate and assist in clearing any potential blockages. 5. Monitor the levels in tanks B202 and B204 closely to ensure that the flow is occurring as expected and that the clogging is being addressed. 6. Once the flow from B202 to B204 is established and the clogging is resolved, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B203 to continue the operation. 7. After all tanks have been emptied into B204, open valve_out to discharge the mixed liquid from B204. 8. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and resolve the blockage. This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to ensure the operation can continue effectively.",
  "confirmation": "This corrective action plan is designed to address the current faults and should be executed by the plant operator agent to retry the operation."

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to halt the transfer from tank B201 to B204, as it is already at its minimum level. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow the liquid from tank B202 to flow into tank B204, which may help in clearing the clogging issue. 4. Adjust the pump power for valve_pump_tank_B202 to 750W to ensure maximum flow rate and assist in clearing any potential blockages. 5. Monitor the levels in tanks B202 and B204 closely to ensure that the flow is occurring as expected and that the clogging is being addressed. 6. Once the flow from B202 to B204 is established and the clogging is resolved, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B203 to continue the operation. 7. After all tanks have been emptied into B204, open valve_out to discharge the mixed liquid from B204. 8. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and resolve the blockage. This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to ensure the operation can continue effectively.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to stop any ongoing transfer from B202 to B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to halt the filling of B204, ensuring that no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to allow any residual liquid in B201 to flow out, which may help alleviate pressure in the system. 4. Adjust pump power to 500W to ensure that the pumps are operating efficiently without overloading, which could exacerbate the clogging issue. 5. After performing these actions, monitor the system for any changes in pressure or flow. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks. 6. Once the clogging issue is resolved, the operator can retry the operation by reopening the necessary valves in the correct sequence to resume the mixing process.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-23 22:11:53][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8.

ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0331175789872009M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO STOP ANY ONGOING TRANSFER FROM B202 TO B204. THIS IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT FURTHER COMPLICATIONS DUE TO THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 2. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO HALT THE FILLING OF B204, ENSURING THAT NO ADDITIONAL LIQUID IS PUSHED THROUGH THE CLOGGED LINE. 3. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO ALLOW ANY RESIDUAL LIQUID IN B201 TO FLOW OUT, WHICH MAY HELP ALLEVIATE PRESSURE IN THE SYSTEM. 4. ADJUST PUMP POWER TO 500W TO ENSURE THAT THE PUMPS ARE OPERATING EFFICIENTLY WITHOUT OVERLOADING, WHICH COULD EXACERBATE THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 5. AFTER PERFORMING THESE ACTIONS, MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY CHANGES IN PRESSURE OR FLOW. IF THE CLOGGING PERSISTS, CONSIDER PERFORMING A MANUAL INSPECTION OF THE LINES CONNECTING THE TANKS. 6. ONCE THE CLOGGING ISSUE IS RESOLVED, THE OPERATOR CAN RETRY THE OPERATION BY REOPENING THE NECESSARY VALVES IN THE CORRECT SEQUENCE TO RESUME THE MIXING PROCESS.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to stop any ongoing transfer from B202 to B204. This is necessary to prevent further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to halt the filling of B204, ensuring that no additional liquid is pushed through the clogged line. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to allow any residual liquid in B201 to flow out, which may help alleviate pressure in the system. 4. Adjust pump power to 500W to ensure that the pumps are operating efficiently without overloading, which could exacerbate the clogging issue. 5. After performing these actions, monitor the system for any changes in pressure or flow. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks. 6. Once the clogging issue is resolved, the operator can retry the operation by reopening the necessary valves in the correct sequence to resume the mixing process.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop any current flow to tank B204. This will help in diagnosing the clogging issue without further complicating the flow. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from tank B202 to B204 while we address the clogging. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to B204, as it is currently at its minimum level and can be emptied. 4. Increase pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow rate and help clear any potential clogging in the lines. 5. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B204, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 6. Once the flow is restored, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to transfer liquid from tank B202 to B204, followed by valve_pump_tank_B203 once B202 is emptied. 7. Finally, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204 once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO START TRANSFERRING LIQUID FROM TANK B201 TO B204, AS IT IS CURRENTLY AT ITS MINIMUM LEVEL AND CAN BE EMPTIED. 4. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 750W TO ENSURE MAXIMUM FLOW RATE AND HELP CLEAR ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING IN THE LINES. 5. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF TANKS B201, B202, AND B204, AND CHECK FOR ANY SIGNS OF FLOW RESTORATION. 6. ONCE THE FLOW IS RESTORED, PROCEED TO OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM TANK B202 TO B204, FOLLOWED BY VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 ONCE B202 IS EMPTIED. 7. FINALLY, OPEN VALVE_OUT TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM B204 ONCE ALL TANKS ARE EMPTIED TO THE MINIMUM LEVEL.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.

- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop the flow from B201 to B204. This is necessary as we need to address the clogging issue before proceeding with any further operations. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow for the filling of tank B204, ensuring that the mixed liquid can be transferred properly once the clogging is resolved. 3. Increase the pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow capacity through the system, which may help in clearing any potential clogging in the lines. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 5. Once the flow is confirmed, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to empty tank B202 into B204, followed by tank B203 after B202 is emptied. This will ensure that all liquids are mixed properly in B204. 6. Finally, once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to discharge the mixed liquid from B204. This step-by-step approach will help in addressing the clogging issue while ensuring that the operational intent is maintained.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop the flow from B201 to B204. This is necessary as we need to address the clogging issue before proceeding with any further operations. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow for the filling of tank B204, ensuring that the mixed liquid can be transferred properly once the clogging is resolved. 3. Increase the pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow capacity through the system, which may help in clearing any potential clogging in the lines. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 5. Once the flow is confirmed, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to empty tank B202 into B204, followed by tank B203 after B202 is emptied. This will ensure that all liquids are mixed properly in B204. 6. Finally, once all tanks are emptied to the minimum level, open valve_out to discharge the mixed liquid from B204. This step-by-step approach will help in addressing the clogging issue while ensuring that the operational intent is maintained.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to attempt to transfer liquid from tank B202 to tank B204, as it is currently full and needs to be emptied. 3. Increase the pump power to 750W to ensure that the pumps can operate at maximum capacity, which may help in overcoming the clogging issue. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B202 and B204, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 5. If the flow is restored, proceed with the normal operation sequence. If not, further investigation into the clogging issue may be required.",

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331175789872009m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to attempt to transfer liquid from tank B202 to tank B204, as it is currently full and needs to be emptied. 3. Increase the pump power to 750W to ensure that the pumps can operate at maximum capacity, which may help in overcoming the clogging issue. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B202 and B204, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 5. If the flow is restored, proceed with the normal operation sequence. If not, further investigation into the clogging issue may be required.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to attempt to transfer liquid from tank B202 to tank B204, as it is currently full and needs to be emptied. 3. Increase the pump power to 750W to ensure that the pumps can operate at maximum capacity, which may help in overcoming the clogging issue. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B202 and B204, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 5. If the flow is restored, proceed with the normal operation sequence. If not, further investigation into the clogging issue may be required.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to stop the flow from tank B202 to B204, as it is currently open and may be contributing to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204, as it is currently closed and needs to be opened to facilitate the mixing process. 3. Reduce the pump power of valve_pump_tank_B204 to 500W to decrease the pressure in the system, which may help alleviate the clogging issue. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in flow and levels in the tanks after these adjustments. 5. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify any physical blockages. 6. Once the adjustments are made, the plant operator should retry the operation to ensure that the mixing process can continue effectively.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-23 22:14:35][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0442459356967249M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO STOP THE FLOW FROM TANK B202 TO B204, AS IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204, AS IT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND NEEDS TO BE OPENED TO FACILITATE THE MIXING PROCESS. 3. REDUCE THE PUMP POWER OF VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO 500W TO DECREASE THE PRESSURE IN THE SYSTEM, WHICH MAY HELP ALLEVIATE THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY CHANGES IN FLOW AND LEVELS IN THE TANKS AFTER THESE ADJUSTMENTS. 5. IF THE CLOGGING PERSISTS, CONSIDER PERFORMING A MANUAL INSPECTION OF THE LINES CONNECTING THE TANKS TO IDENTIFY ANY PHYSICAL BLOCKAGES. 6. ONCE THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE, THE PLANT OPERATOR SHOULD RETRY THE OPERATION TO ENSURE THAT THE MIXING PROCESS CAN CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from tank B203, which is currently full and could exacerbate the clogging issue. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to tank B204. This will help to relieve pressure in the system and allow for a potential clearing of the clog. 4.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from tank B203, which is currently full and could exacerbate the clogging issue. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to tank B204. This will help to relieve pressure in the system and allow for a potential clearing of the clog. 4. Adjust the pump power to 500W to ensure that the pump operates efficiently without exceeding its maximum capacity. 5. Monitor the system closely for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of clearing in the clog. 6. Once the levels in B201 and B202 reach the minimum threshold, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to continue the operation. 7. If the clog persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and resolve the blockage. This step is crucial to ensure the system can operate effectively in the future.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from tank B203, which is currently full and could exacerbate the clogging issue. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to tank B204. This will help to relieve pressure in the system and allow for a potential clearing of the clog. 4. Adjust the pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow rate and assist in clearing the clog. 5. Monitor the system closely for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 6. Once the levels in B201 and B202 reach the minimum threshold, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to continue the operation. 7. If the clog persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and resolve the obstruction.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to effectively address the clogging issue and resume normal operations."

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442459356967249m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from tank B203, which is currently full and could exacerbate the clogging issue. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to tank B204. This will help to relieve pressure in the system and allow for a potential clearing of the clog. 4. Adjust the pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow rate and assist in clearing the clog. 5. Monitor the system closely for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 6. Once the levels in B201 and B202 reach the minimum threshold, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to continue the operation. 7. If the clog persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and resolve the obstruction.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from tank B203, which is currently full and could exacerbate the clogging issue. 3. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to start transferring liquid from tank B201 to tank B204. This will help to relieve pressure in the system and allow for a potential clearing of the clog. 4. Adjust the pump power to 750W to ensure maximum flow rate and assist in clearing the clog. 5. Monitor the system closely for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow restoration. 6. Once the levels in B201 and B202 reach the minimum threshold, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B202 to continue the operation. 7. If the clog persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and resolve the obstruction.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.
  - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
    - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
    - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
    - **Output Valve:** valve_out

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m

  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

{
  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop the flow from B201 to B204. This is necessary as we need to address the clogging issue before continuing with the operation. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to prevent any further liquid transfer from B202 to B204, ensuring that we can safely troubleshoot the clogging. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to stop any flow from B203 to B204, as it is currently not open and we need to ensure all valves are in a safe state. 4. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow for any potential backflow or pressure relief, which may help in clearing the clogging issue. 5. Adjust the pump power to 500W to ensure that the pump operates effectively without overloading, allowing for a controlled flow. 6. Monitor the system for any changes in pressure or flow rates to identify if the clogging is resolved. 7. Once the clogging is addressed, sequentially open valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to resume the mixing process, ensuring that each tank is emptied properly into B204. 8. Finally, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204 once all tanks have been emptied to the minimum level.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to effectively resolve the clogging issue and continue the operation."

STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO STOP THE FLOW FROM B201 TO B204. THIS IS NECESSARY AS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CLOGGING ISSUE BEFORE CONTINUING WITH THE OPERATION. 2. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER LIQUID TRANSFER FROM B202 TO B204, ENSURING THAT WE CAN SAFELY TROUBLESHOOT THE CLOGGING. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO STOP ANY FLOW FROM B203 TO B204, AS IT IS CURRENTLY NOT OPEN AND WE NEED TO ENSURE ALL VALVES ARE IN A SAFE STATE. 4. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO ALLOW FOR ANY POTENTIAL BACKFLOW OR PRESSURE RELIEF, WHICH MAY HELP IN CLEARING THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 5. ADJUST THE PUMP POWER TO 500W TO ENSURE THAT THE PUMP OPERATES EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT OVERLOADING, ALLOWING FOR A CONTROLLED FLOW. 6. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY CHANGES IN PRESSURE OR FLOW RATES TO IDENTIFY IF THE CLOGGING IS RESOLVED. 7. ONCE THE CLOGGING IS ADDRESSED, SEQUENTIALLY OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, AND VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO RESUME THE MIXING PROCESS, ENSURING THAT EACH TANK IS EMPTIED PROPERLY INTO B204. 8. FINALLY, OPEN VALVE_OUT TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM B204 ONCE ALL TANKS HAVE BEEN EMPTIED TO THE MINIMUM LEVEL.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop the flow from B201 to B204. This is necessary as we need to address the clogging issue before continuing with the operation. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to prevent any further liquid transfer from B202 to B204, ensuring that we can safely troubleshoot the clogging. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to stop any flow from B203 to B204, as it is currently not open and we need to ensure all valves are in a safe state. 4. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow for any potential backflow or pressure relief, which may help in clearing the clogging issue. 5. Adjust the pump power to 500W to ensure that the pump operates effectively without overloading, allowing for a controlled flow. 6. Monitor the system for any changes in pressure or flow rates to identify if the clogging is resolved. 7. Once the clogging is addressed, sequentially open valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, and valve_pump_tank_B203 to resume the mixing process, ensuring that each tank is emptied properly into B204. 8. Finally, open valve_out to empty the mixed liquid from B204 once all tanks have been emptied to the minimum level.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.
  - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
    - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
    - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
    - **Output Valve:** valve_out

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

Adjust the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to ensure that the pumps are operating within a safe range while we troubleshoot the clogging issue. 6. Monitor the system for any signs of improvement or further issues. Once the clog is resolved, we can proceed with the normal operation sequence again. 7. After confirming that the clog has been cleared, we can sequentially reopen the valves for B201, B202, and B203 to resume the mixing process. 8. Ensure that the levels in tanks B201 and B202 are at their minimum before attempting to refill them. 9. Communicate to the plant operator that these steps should be followed to ensure safe and effective recovery from the current fault.",

Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 to stop the flow from B201 to B204. This is necessary as we need to address the clogging issue before proceeding with any further operations. 2. Close valve_pump_tank_B202 to stop any potential flow from B202 to B204. This will help isolate the problem and prevent further complications. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure that no liquid is being transferred from B203 to B204 while we assess the situation. 4. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow for any residual liquid in B204 to be emptied, which may help alleviate pressure and assist in clearing the clog. 5. Adjust the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to ensure that the pumps are operating within a safe range while we troubleshoot the clogging issue. 6. Monitor the system for any signs of improvement or further issues. Once the clog is resolved, we can proceed with the normal operation sequence again. 7. After confirming that the clog has been cleared, we can sequentially reopen the valves for B201, B202, and B203 to resume the mixing process. 8. Ensure that the levels in tanks B201 and B202 are at their minimum before attempting to refill them. 9. Communicate to the plant operator that these steps should be followed to ensure safe and effective recovery from the current fault.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-23 22:16:39][‚úÖ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**SYSTEM OVERVIEW:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8.

ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.044254359499781M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 TO STOP THE FLOW FROM B201 TO B204. THIS IS NECESSARY AS WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CLOGGING ISSUE BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY FURTHER OPERATIONS. 2. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO STOP ANY POTENTIAL FLOW FROM B202 TO B204. THIS WILL HELP ISOLATE THE PROBLEM AND PREVENT FURTHER COMPLICATIONS. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ENSURE THAT NO LIQUID IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM B203 TO B204 WHILE WE ASSESS THE SITUATION. 4. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO ALLOW FOR ANY RESIDUAL LIQUID IN B204 TO BE EMPTIED, WHICH MAY HELP ALLEVIATE PRESSURE AND ASSIST IN CLEARING THE CLOG. 5. ADJUST THE PUMP POWER TO 0.5 (375W) TO ENSURE THAT THE PUMPS ARE OPERATING WITHIN A SAFE RANGE WHILE WE TROUBLESHOOT THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 6. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT OR FURTHER ISSUES. ONCE THE CLOG IS RESOLVED, WE CAN PROCEED WITH THE NORMAL OPERATION SEQUENCE AGAIN. 7. AFTER CONFIRMING THAT THE CLOG HAS BEEN CLEARED, WE CAN SEQUENTIALLY REOPEN THE VALVES FOR B201, B202, AND B203 TO RESUME THE MIXING PROCESS. 8. ENSURE THAT THE LEVELS IN TANKS B201 AND B202 ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO REFILL THEM. 9. COMMUNICATE TO THE PLANT OPERATOR THAT THESE STEPS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED TO ENSURE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE RECOVERY FROM THE CURRENT FAULT.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure no liquid is being transferred from tank B203. This is necessary to prevent any further obstruction or issues while we address the clogging. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow tank B204 to receive liquid from the other tanks. This will help maintain flow and prevent any overflow or pressure build-up in the system. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W) to ensure maximum flow capacity through the system, which may help in clearing any clogging in the lines. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow improvement. 5. Once the flow is restored, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B203 again to continue the operation. 6. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and clear the obstruction.

**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ENSURE NO LIQUID IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM TANK B203. THIS IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER OBSTRUCTION OR ISSUES WHILE WE ADDRESS THE CLOGGING. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO ALLOW TANK B204 TO RECEIVE LIQUID FROM THE OTHER TANKS. THIS WILL HELP MAINTAIN FLOW AND PREVENT ANY OVERFLOW OR PRESSURE BUILD-UP IN THE SYSTEM. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (750W) TO ENSURE MAXIMUM FLOW CAPACITY THROUGH THE SYSTEM, WHICH MAY HELP IN CLEARING ANY CLOGGING IN THE LINES. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF TANKS B201, B202, AND B203, AND CHECK FOR ANY SIGNS OF FLOW IMPROVEMENT. 5. ONCE THE FLOW IS RESTORED, PROCEED TO OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 AGAIN TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION. 6. IF THE CLOGGING PERSISTS, CONSIDER PERFORMING A MANUAL INSPECTION OF THE LINES CONNECTING THE TANKS TO IDENTIFY AND CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION. THIS STEP IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THE SYSTEM OPERATES EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure no liquid is being transferred from tank B203. This is necessary to prevent any further obstruction or issues while we address the clogging. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow tank B204 to receive liquid from the other tanks. This will help maintain flow and prevent any overflow or pressure build-up in the system. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W) to ensure maximum flow capacity through the system, which may help in clearing any clogging in the lines. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in the levels of tanks B201, B202, and B203, and check for any signs of flow improvement. 5. Once the flow is restored, proceed to open valve_pump_tank_B203 again to continue the operation. 6. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and clear the obstruction. This step is crucial to ensure the system operates effectively and safely.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977993M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0219999998977999M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.044254359499781M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE IN THE MENTIONED ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ENSURE NO LIQUID IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM TANK B203. THIS IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER OBSTRUCTION OR ISSUES WHILE WE ADDRESS THE CLOGGING. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO ALLOW TANK B204 TO RECEIVE LIQUID FROM THE OTHER TANKS. THIS WILL HELP MAINTAIN FLOW AND PREVENT ANY OVERFLOW OR PRESSURE BUILD-UP IN THE SYSTEM. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (750W) TO ENSURE MAXIMUM FLOW CAPACITY THROUGH THE SYSTEM, WHICH MAY HELP IN CLEARING ANY CLOGGING IN THE LINES. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF TANKS B201, B202, AND B203, AND CHECK FOR ANY SIGNS OF FLOW IMPROVEMENT. 5. ONCE THE FLOW IS RESTORED, PROCEED TO OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 AGAIN TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION. 6. IF THE CLOGGING PERSISTS, CONSIDER PERFORMING A MANUAL INSPECTION OF THE LINES CONNECTING THE TANKS TO IDENTIFY AND CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION. THIS STEP IS CRUCIAL TO ENSURE THE SYSTEM OPERATES EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B203 to ensure no liquid is being transferred from B203 to B204, as it is currently not open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to allow for the filling of tank B204 from the other tanks. 3. Increase pump power to 750W to ensure sufficient pressure for liquid transfer and to overcome any potential clogging in the lines. 4. Monitor the system for any changes in liquid levels in tanks B201, B202, and B204 to ensure that the flow is restored. 5. If the clogging persists, consider performing a manual inspection of the lines connecting the tanks to identify and clear any obstructions.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to attempt to clear the clogging in the line connecting tank B203 to B204. This will help to ensure that any liquid in tank B203 can be transferred properly. 3. Adjust the pump power for valve_pump_tank_B203 to 0.5 (375W) to provide sufficient power to overcome the clogging without risking damage to the system. 4. Monitor the levels in tank B203 and the flow rate to ensure that the clog is being cleared. 5. Once the clog is cleared and the liquid is flowing properly, close valve_pump_tank_B203 and reopen valve_pump_tank_B204 to resume normal operations. 6. After confirming that all tanks are at their required levels, proceed with the original sequence of operations to fill and empty the tanks as intended.",

**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO STOP THE CURRENT FLOW TO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER COMPLICATIONS DUE TO THE CLOGGING ISSUE. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO ATTEMPT TO CLEAR THE CLOGGING IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANK B203 TO B204. THIS WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT ANY LIQUID IN TANK B203 CAN BE TRANSFERRED PROPERLY. 3. ADJUST THE PUMP POWER FOR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 TO 0.5 (375W) TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING WITHOUT RISKING DAMAGE TO THE SYSTEM. 4. MONITOR THE LEVELS IN TANK B203 AND THE FLOW RATE TO ENSURE THAT THE CLOG IS BEING CLEARED. 5. ONCE THE CLOG IS CLEARED AND THE LIQUID IS FLOWING PROPERLY, CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 AND REOPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 TO RESUME NORMAL OPERATIONS. 6. AFTER CONFIRMING THAT ALL TANKS ARE AT THEIR REQUIRED LEVELS, PROCEED WITH THE ORIGINAL SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS TO FILL AND EMPTY THE TANKS AS INTENDED.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977993m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977999m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.044254359499781m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the operational procedure in the mentioned order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_pump_tank_B204 to stop the current flow to tank B204. This is necessary to prevent any further complications due to the clogging issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to attempt to clear the clogging in the line connecting tank B203 to B204. This will help to ensure that any liquid in tank B203 can be transferred properly. 3. Adjust the pump power for valve_pump_tank_B203 to 0.5 (375W) to provide sufficient power to overcome the clogging without risking damage to the system. 4. Monitor the levels in tank B203 and the flow rate to ensure that the clog is being cleared. 5. Once the clog is cleared and the liquid is flowing properly, close valve_pump_tank_B203 and reopen valve_pump_tank_B204 to resume normal operations. 6. After confirming that all tanks are at their required levels, proceed with the original sequence of operations to fill and empty the tanks as intended.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
