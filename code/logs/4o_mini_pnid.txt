[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-26 00:05:31][📋 TASK STARTED: FOLLOW THESE RULES: - ONLY ACT WITHIN THE CURRENT STATE. DO NOT ANTICIPATE FUTURE STEPS. - TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES FOLLOW A STRICT FINITE-STATE MACHINE. YOU MUST ONLY ADVANCE IF THE TRANSITION CONDITION IS MET. - IF THE CONDITION FOR TRANSITION IS NOT MET, CONTINUE CURRENT OPERATIONS OR RETURN NO NEW ACTIONS. - DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT SKIP STATES.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS AND FLOW PATHS BETWEEN TANKS AND VALVES. THE P&ID DIAGRAM IS REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS IN A GRAPH FORMAT:
  {'VALVE_IN0': 'TANK_B201', 'TANK_B201': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201', 'VALVE_IN1': 'TANK_B202', 'TANK_B202': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202', 'VALVE_IN2': 'TANK_B203', 'TANK_B203': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204': 'TANK_B204', 'TANK_B204': 'VALVE_OUT', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'PUMP_N_IN': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204'}

**STATE GRAPH:** - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES AS FOLLOWS:
  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END
  
- BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:
  - FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 IF B201 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 IF B202 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 IF B203 > 0.032M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 IF B201 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 IF B202 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END IF B203 < 0.022M

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in1 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in1 to allow flow from tank B202. Reasoning: The current state indicates that tank B202 is at the minimum required level (0.022m), and valve_in1 is currently closed, preventing the transfer of liquid from B202 to B204. Opening this valve is necessary to proceed with the mixing operation. 2. Ensure that valve_in0 and valve_in2 remain closed. Reasoning: Since we are currently filling from tank B202, only valve_in1 should be open to avoid any cross-contamination or unintended flow from other tanks. 3. Maintain the pump power at 0W. Reasoning: The pump is not required to be activated until the valves are correctly set to allow flow into tank B204. Once valve_in1 is opened, the pump can be activated if needed for further operations. 4. Confirm the status of all valves and the pump before retrying the operation. Reasoning: This ensures that the system is in the correct state to proceed without further issues.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in1 to allow flow from tank B202. Reasoning: The current state indicates that tank B202 is at the minimum required level (0.022m), and valve_in1 is currently closed, preventing the transfer of liquid from B202 to B204. Opening this valve is necessary to proceed with the mixing operation. 2. Ensure that valve_in0 and valve_in2 remain closed. Reasoning: Since we are currently filling from tank B202, only valve_in1 should be open to avoid any cross-contamination or unintended flow from other tanks. 3. Maintain the pump power at 0W. Reasoning: The pump is not required to be activated until the valves are correctly set to allow flow into tank B204. Once valve_in1 is opened, the pump can be activated if needed for further operations. 4. Confirm the status of all valves and the pump before retrying the operation. Reasoning: This ensures that the system is in the correct state to proceed without further issues.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 1.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m

  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B203. This is necessary because the current state indicates that the mixing process is not progressing as tank B203 is not contributing to the mixture. 2. Close valve_in0 (set to 0.0) as it is currently closed and not needed for the operation. 3. Keep valve_in1 open (set to 1.0) since it is required for the flow from tank B202. 4. Ensure that the pump power remains at 0.0 as it is not required to change the pump power at this stage since the valves are not correctly set for the operation. 5. Confirm that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains closed (set to 0.0) until the mixing is complete. 6. Check the status of valve_out and keep it closed (set to 0.0) to prevent any outflow during the mixing process.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END
  
- BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:
  - FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 IF B201 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 IF B202 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 IF B203 > 0.032M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 IF B201 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 IF B202 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END IF B203 < 0.022M

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 (SET TO 1.0) TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B203. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT THE MIXING PROCESS IS NOT PROGRESSING AS TANK B203 IS NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE MIXTURE. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 (SET TO 0.0) AS IT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND NOT NEEDED FOR THE OPERATION. 3. KEEP VALVE_IN1 OPEN (SET TO 1.0) SINCE IT IS REQUIRED FOR THE FLOW FROM TANK B202. 4. ENSURE THAT THE PUMP POWER REMAINS AT 0.0 AS IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO CHANGE THE PUMP POWER AT THIS STAGE SINCE THE VALVES ARE NOT CORRECTLY SET FOR THE OPERATION. 5. CONFIRM THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS CLOSED (SET TO 0.0) UNTIL THE MIXING IS COMPLETE. 6. CHECK THE STATUS OF VALVE_OUT AND KEEP IT CLOSED (SET TO 0.0) TO PREVENT ANY OUTFLOW DURING THE MIXING PROCESS.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 1.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B203 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_in2 is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from tank B203. 2. Close valve_in0 (set to 0.0) as it is currently open but not required for the operation since we are transferring from tank B203. 3. Keep valve_in1 open (set to 1.0) as it is necessary for the operation. 4. Ensure that the pump power remains at 0.0 since it is not required to change the pump power at this stage. The current state of the system indicates that the flow from tank B203 is blocked due to valve_in2 being closed, and we need to correct this to proceed with the operation.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B203 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_in2 is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from tank B203. 2. Close valve_in0 (set to 0.0) as it is currently open but not required for the operation since we are transferring from tank B203. 3. Keep valve_in1 open (set to 1.0) as it is necessary for the operation. 4. Ensure that the pump power remains at 0.0 since it is not required to change the pump power at this stage. The current state of the system indicates that the flow from tank B203 is blocked due to valve_in2 being closed, and we need to correct this to proceed with the operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 1.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B203 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_in2 is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from tank B203. 2. Close valve_in0 (set to 0.0) and valve_in1 (set to 0.0) to ensure that only the required valve (valve_in2) is open for the current operation. This will prevent any unnecessary flow from tanks B201 and B202, which are not needed at this stage. 3. Maintain the pump power at 0.0 since the current operation does not require pumping at this moment. The pump should only be activated once the valves are correctly set to facilitate the flow. 4. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains closed (set to 0.0) until the liquid is ready to be pumped into tank B204. This will prevent any overflow or unintended mixing. 5. Confirm that the system is ready to transition to the next state (fill_tank_B203) once valve_in2 is opened and the conditions are met.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 (set to 1.0) to allow flow from tank B203 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that valve_in2 is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from tank B203. 2. Close valve_in0 (set to 0.0) and valve_in1 (set to 0.0) to ensure that only the required valve (valve_in2) is open for the current operation. This will prevent any unnecessary flow from tanks B201 and B202, which are not needed at this stage. 3. Maintain the pump power at 0.0 since the current operation does not require pumping at this moment. The pump should only be activated once the valves are correctly set to facilitate the flow. 4. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B204 remains closed (set to 0.0) until the liquid is ready to be pumped into tank B204. This will prevent any overflow or unintended mixing. 5. Confirm that the system is ready to transition to the next state (fill_tank_B203) once valve_in2 is opened and the conditions are met.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-26 00:08:37][✅ TASK COMPLETED: FOLLOW THESE RULES: - ONLY ACT WITHIN THE CURRENT STATE. DO NOT ANTICIPATE FUTURE STEPS. - TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES FOLLOW A STRICT FINITE-STATE MACHINE. YOU MUST ONLY ADVANCE IF THE TRANSITION CONDITION IS MET. - IF THE CONDITION FOR TRANSITION IS NOT MET, CONTINUE CURRENT OPERATIONS OR RETURN NO NEW ACTIONS. - DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT SKIP STATES.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS AND FLOW PATHS BETWEEN TANKS AND VALVES. THE P&ID DIAGRAM IS REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS IN A GRAPH FORMAT:
  {'VALVE_IN0': 'TANK_B201', 'TANK_B201': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201', 'VALVE_IN1': 'TANK_B202', 'TANK_B202': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202', 'VALVE_IN2': 'TANK_B203', 'TANK_B203': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204': 'TANK_B204', 'TANK_B204': 'VALVE_OUT', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'PUMP_N_IN': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204'}

**STATE GRAPH:** - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES AS FOLLOWS:
  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END
  
- BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:
  - FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 IF B201 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 IF B202 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 IF B203 > 0.032M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 IF B201 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 IF B202 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END IF B203 < 0.022M

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 (SET TO 1.0) TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B203 INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT VALVE_IN2 IS CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING THE TRANSFER OF LIQUID FROM TANK B203. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN0 (SET TO 0.0) AND VALVE_IN1 (SET TO 0.0) TO ENSURE THAT ONLY THE REQUIRED VALVE (VALVE_IN2) IS OPEN FOR THE CURRENT OPERATION. THIS WILL PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW FROM TANKS B201 AND B202, WHICH ARE NOT NEEDED AT THIS STAGE. 3. MAINTAIN THE PUMP POWER AT 0.0 SINCE THE CURRENT OPERATION DOES NOT REQUIRE PUMPING AT THIS MOMENT. THE PUMP SHOULD ONLY BE ACTIVATED ONCE THE VALVES ARE CORRECTLY SET TO FACILITATE THE FLOW. 4. ENSURE THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS CLOSED (SET TO 0.0) UNTIL THE LIQUID IS READY TO BE PUMPED INTO TANK B204. THIS WILL PREVENT ANY OVERFLOW OR UNINTENDED MIXING. 5. CONFIRM THAT THE SYSTEM IS READY TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE (FILL_TANK_B203) ONCE VALVE_IN2 IS OPENED AND THE CONDITIONS ARE MET.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 1.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to allow flow from tank B201 into the mixing process. This is necessary because the current state indicates that this valve is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from tank B201. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to enable the outflow of the mixed liquid into the next stage or to the output. This valve is also currently closed, which is causing a blockage in the system. 3. Keep valve_in0, valve_in1, and valve_in2 closed as they are not required for the current operation since we are focusing on transferring liquid from tank B201. 4. Maintain the pump power at 0.0 as it is not required to change the pump power at this moment since the valves need to be opened first to allow flow. 5. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B202 and valve_pump_tank_B203 remain closed as they are not needed for the current operation. This will prevent unnecessary flow and maintain system stability.",

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 to allow flow from tank B201 into the mixing process. This is necessary because the current state indicates that this valve is closed, which is preventing the transfer of liquid from tank B201. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204 to enable the outflow of the mixed liquid into the next stage or to the output. This valve is also currently closed, which is causing a blockage in the system. 3. Keep valve_in0, valve_in1, and valve_in2 closed as they are not required for the current operation since we are focusing on transferring liquid from tank B201. 4. Maintain the pump power at 0.0 as it is not required to change the pump power at this moment since the valves need to be opened first to allow flow. 5. Ensure that valve_pump_tank_B202 and valve_pump_tank_B203 remain closed as they are not needed for the current operation. This will prevent unnecessary flow and maintain system stability.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  **STATE GRAPH:**
  - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES.
  - THE TRANSITIONS HAPPEN ONLY WHEN THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. 
  - THE STATE GRAPH IS AS FOLLOWS:
    FILL_TANK_B201 --> FILL_TANK_B202 --> FILL_TANK_B203 --> DRAIN_TANK_B201 --> DRAIN_TANK_B202 --> DRAIN_TANK_B203 --> END

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow flow from tank B202 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that tank B202 is above the required level (0.033m), and the valve must be opened to proceed with the mixing operation. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open, as it is currently open and necessary for transferring the mixed liquid to the output. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, as it is currently open but not needed for the next operation since we are transitioning from tank B202 to tank B204. This will prevent unnecessary flow from tank B201. 4. Maintain the pump power at 1.0 (750W) since it is already set to the maximum and is required to ensure adequate flow through the system. 5. Confirm that valve_out remains closed, as it is not needed during the filling process. These actions will correct the current state and allow the system to transition to the next state successfully.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m

  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202 to allow flow from tank B202 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that tank B202 is above the required level (0.033m), and the valve must be opened to proceed with the mixing operation. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open, as it is currently open and necessary for transferring the mixed liquid to the output. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201, as it is currently open but not needed for the next operation since we are transitioning from tank B202 to tank B204. This will prevent unnecessary flow from tank B201. 4. Maintain the pump power at 1.0 (750W) since it is already set to the maximum and is required to ensure adequate flow through the system. 5. Confirm that valve_out remains closed, as it is not needed during the filling process. These actions will correct the current state and allow the system to transition to the next state successfully.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  {'VALVE_IN0': 'TANK_B201', 'TANK_B201': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201', 'VALVE_IN1': 'TANK_B202', 'TANK_B202': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202', 'VALVE_IN2': 'TANK_B203', 'TANK_B203': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204': 'TANK_B204', 'TANK_B204': 'VALVE_OUT', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'PUMP_N_IN': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204'}

**STATE GRAPH:** - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES AS FOLLOWS:
  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END
  
- BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B202 INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT TANK B202 IS ABOVE THE REQUIRED LEVEL (0.033M), AND THE VALVE MUST BE OPENED TO PROCEED WITH THE MIXING OPERATION. 2. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN, AS IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND NECESSARY FOR TRANSFERRING THE MIXED LIQUID TO THE OUTPUT. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, AS IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN BUT NOT NEEDED FOR THE NEXT OPERATION SINCE WE ARE TRANSITIONING FROM TANK B202 TO TANK B204. THIS WILL PREVENT UNNECESSARY FLOW FROM TANK B201. 4. MAINTAIN THE PUMP POWER AT 1.0 (750W) SINCE IT IS ALREADY SET TO THE MAXIMUM AND IS REQUIRED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM. 5. CONFIRM THAT VALVE_OUT REMAINS CLOSED, AS IT IS NOT NEEDED DURING THE FILLING PROCESS. THESE ACTIONS WILL CORRECT THE CURRENT STATE AND ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE SUCCESSFULLY.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m

  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow flow from tank B203 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that tank B203 has sufficient liquid (0.033m) to proceed with the mixing operation. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open as it is required to transfer the mixed liquid from tank B204 to the next stage. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 as they are not needed at this moment since we are focusing on transferring liquid from tank B203. 4. Maintain the pump power at 0.0 as it is not required to change the pump power at this stage since the valves are the primary concern for the current operation.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203 to allow flow from tank B203 into tank B204. This is necessary because the current state indicates that tank B203 has sufficient liquid (0.033m) to proceed with the mixing operation. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open as it is required to transfer the mixed liquid from tank B204 to the next stage. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B202 as they are not needed at this moment since we are focusing on transferring liquid from tank B203. 4. Maintain the pump power at 0.0 as it is not required to change the pump power at this stage since the valves are the primary concern for the current operation.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):

  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This valve is currently open, allowing the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary as tank B203 has sufficient liquid (0.033m) to continue the operation. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve is currently open, allowing the mixed liquid to exit into the next stage or to the output. This is essential for the operation to proceed. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B201 is below the required level (0.022m), it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 4. Close valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B202 is also below the required level (0.022m), it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 5. Maintain pump power at 0: The pump power is currently at 0, which is appropriate as the system is not in a state to require pumping at this moment. The current state of the system indicates that the operation cannot proceed until the necessary valves are opened and the conditions for the next state are met.",

OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN, ALLOWING THE MIXED LIQUID TO EXIT INTO THE NEXT STAGE OR TO THE OUTPUT. THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE OPERATION TO PROCEED. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, AND SINCE TANK B201 IS BELOW THE REQUIRED LEVEL (0.022M), IT SHOULD REMAIN CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW. 4. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, AND SINCE TANK B202 IS ALSO BELOW THE REQUIRED LEVEL (0.022M), IT SHOULD REMAIN CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW. 5.

  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This valve is currently open, allowing the liquid from tank B203 to flow into tank B204. This is necessary as tank B203 has sufficient liquid (0.033m) to continue the operation. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve is currently open, allowing the mixed liquid to exit into the next stage or to the output. This is essential for the operation to proceed. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B201 is below the required level (0.022m), it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 4. Close valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B202 is also below the required level (0.022m), it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 5. Maintain pump power at 0: The pump power is currently at 0, which is appropriate as the system is not in a state to require pumping at this moment. The current state of the system indicates that the operation cannot proceed until the necessary valves are opened and the conditions for the next state are met.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN, ALLOWING THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. THIS IS NECESSARY AS TANK B203 HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUID (0.033M) TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN, ALLOWING THE MIXED LIQUID TO EXIT INTO THE NEXT STAGE OR TO THE OUTPUT. THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE OPERATION TO PROCEED. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, AND SINCE TANK B201 IS BELOW THE REQUIRED LEVEL (0.022M), IT SHOULD REMAIN CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW. 4. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, AND SINCE TANK B202 IS ALSO BELOW THE REQUIRED LEVEL (0.022M), IT SHOULD REMAIN CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY UNNECESSARY FLOW. 5. MAINTAIN PUMP POWER AT 0: THE PUMP POWER IS CURRENTLY AT 0, WHICH IS APPROPRIATE AS THE SYSTEM IS NOT IN A STATE TO REQUIRE PUMPING AT THIS MOMENT. THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SYSTEM INDICATES THAT THE OPERATION CANNOT PROCEED UNTIL THE NECESSARY VALVES ARE OPENED AND THE CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT STATE ARE MET.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:

  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

It is essential to keep this valve open to ensure the mixing process continues. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B201 is below the required level, it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 4. Close valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B202 is also below the required level, it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 5. Maintain pump power at 0: The pump power is currently at 0, which is appropriate since the system is not in a state to require pumping at this moment. The current state of the system indicates that the flow from tank B203 is sufficient for the operation. 6. Ensure that valve_in2 remains open: This valve is currently open, allowing the flow from tank B203 to continue. It is necessary to keep this valve open to maintain the flow from tank B203. 7. Confirm that valve_out remains closed: This valve is currently closed, which is appropriate as we do not want to drain the tank B204 at this moment. The system needs to maintain the liquid for mixing. 8. Monitor the levels in tanks B201 and B202: Since both tanks are below the required level, it is crucial to monitor them closely to ensure they are filled appropriately before proceeding to the next steps.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to ensure the operation proceeds effectively."

[2025-04-26 00:13:35][✅ TASK COMPLETED: WHEN THE VALIDATION AGENT DETECTS THAT AN ACTION WAS NOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER), THIS AGENT RECEIVES THE FAULT CONTEXT AND CURRENT SYSTEM STATE.
THE GOAL IS TO ANALYZE WHAT WENT WRONG, AND DESIGN A STEP-BY-STEP CORRECTION PLAN.
**PLANT FUNCTION:**
  - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.

**PLANT STRUCTURE:**
  - THE SYSTEM P&ID DIAGRAM IS AS FOLLOWS (STRUCTURED AS A NODE-EDGE FORMAT OR TEXTUAL DESCRIPTION):
    {'VALVE_IN0': 'TANK_B201', 'TANK_B201': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201', 'VALVE_IN1': 'TANK_B202', 'TANK_B202': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202', 'VALVE_IN2': 'TANK_B203', 'TANK_B203': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204': 'TANK_B204', 'TANK_B204': 'VALVE_OUT', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'PUMP_N_IN': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204'}

  **STATE GRAPH:**
  - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES.
  - THE TRANSITIONS HAPPEN ONLY WHEN THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. 
  - THE STATE GRAPH IS AS FOLLOWS:
    FILL_TANK_B201 --> FILL_TANK_B202 --> FILL_TANK_B203 --> DRAIN_TANK_B201 --> DRAIN_TANK_B202 --> DRAIN_TANK_B203 --> END
    BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:
    - FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202  IF B201 > 0.032M
    - FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203  IF B202 > 0.032M
    - FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 IF B203 > 0.032M
    - DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 IF B201 < 0.022M
    - DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 IF B202 < 0.022M
    - DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END IF B203 < 0.022M

  - ANALYSE THE STATE GRAPH AND IDENTIFY THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SYSTEM.
  - BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE, IDENTIFY THE NEXT STATE AND THE CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO TRANSITION TO THAT STATE.
  - TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE ONLY WHEN THE CONDITIONS ARE MET.

**CURRENT STATE:**
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M

**SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:**
  - VALVES B201, B202, B203 AND B204 ARE SOLENOID VALVES THAT IS ON OR OFF ONLY. 
  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS NOT OPEN OR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. EXACTLY 2 DESIRED VALVES ARE NOT OPEN..
  - LOOK AT THE ISSUE AND ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SYSTEM.
  - IDENTIFY THE VALVES/PUMP POWER CASUING THIS ISSUE AND SUGGEST CORRECTIVE ACTION.
  - CHECK ALL THE ACTUATORS FOR THEIR CURRENT STATE AND SUGGEST CORRECTIVE ACTION.
  - IF MORE VALVES ARE OPEN THEN REQUIRED, SUGGEST CLOSING THE EXTRA VALVES AND ONLY KEEPING THE REQUIRED VALVES OPEN.
  - DO NOT CHANGE THE PUMP POWER IF NOT REQUIRED.
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This valve is currently open, allowing the flow from tank B203 to tank B204. It is necessary to keep this valve open to maintain the flow of liquid from tank B203. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve is currently open, allowing the liquid to flow from tank B204 to the next stage. It is essential to keep this valve open to ensure the mixing process continues. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B201 is below the required level, it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 4. Close valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently closed, and since tank B202 is also below the required level, it should remain closed to prevent any unnecessary flow. 5. Maintain pump power at 0: The pump power is currently at 0, which is appropriate since the system is not in a state to require pumping at this moment. The current state of the system indicates that the flow from tank B203 is sufficient for the operation. 6. Ensure that valve_in2 remains open: This valve is currently open, allowing the flow from tank B203 to continue. It is necessary to keep this valve open to maintain the flow from tank B203. 7. Confirm that valve_out remains closed: This valve is currently closed, which is appropriate as we do not want to drain the tank B204 at this moment. The system needs to maintain the liquid for mixing. 8. Monitor the levels in tanks B201 and B202: Since both tanks are below the required level, it is crucial to monitor them closely to ensure they are filled appropriately before proceeding to the next steps.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
