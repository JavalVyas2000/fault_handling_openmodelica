[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-26 00:20:25][📋 TASK STARTED: FOLLOW THESE RULES: - ONLY ACT WITHIN THE CURRENT STATE. DO NOT ANTICIPATE FUTURE STEPS. - TRANSITIONS BETWEEN STATES FOLLOW A STRICT FINITE-STATE MACHINE. YOU MUST ONLY ADVANCE IF THE TRANSITION CONDITION IS MET. - IF THE CONDITION FOR TRANSITION IS NOT MET, CONTINUE CURRENT OPERATIONS OR RETURN NO NEW ACTIONS. - DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT SKIP STATES.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS AND FLOW PATHS BETWEEN TANKS AND VALVES. THE P&ID DIAGRAM IS REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS IN A GRAPH FORMAT:
  {'VALVE_IN0': 'TANK_B201', 'TANK_B201': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201', 'VALVE_IN1': 'TANK_B202', 'TANK_B202': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202', 'VALVE_IN2': 'TANK_B203', 'TANK_B203': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204': 'TANK_B204', 'TANK_B204': 'VALVE_OUT', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'PUMP_N_IN': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204'}

**STATE GRAPH:** - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES AS FOLLOWS:
  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END
  
- BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:
  - FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 IF B201 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 IF B202 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 IF B203 > 0.032M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 IF B201 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 IF B202 < 0.022M
  - DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END IF B203 < 0.022M

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 1.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in1 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in1: The current state indicates that valve_in1 is closed (0.0), but it should be open (1.0) to allow the transfer of liquid from tank B202 to tank B204. This is necessary to transition from the current state to the next state in the sequence. 2. Close valve_in0: Since the level in tank B201 is already above the required threshold (0.033m > 0.032m), valve_in0 should be closed to prevent overfilling. 3. Ensure all other valves remain closed: valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, and valve_out should remain closed to maintain the current state and prevent any unintended flow. 4. Maintain current pump power: The pump power is currently set to 0.0, which is appropriate as no pumping action is required at this stage.",
  "confirmation": "The suggested corrective actions should be retried by the plant operator agent to ensure the system transitions correctly to the next state. By opening valve_in1 and closing valve_in0, the system will be aligned with the operational intent and ready for the next sequence in the process."

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in1: The current state indicates that valve_in1 is closed (0.0), but it should be open (1.0) to allow the transfer of liquid from tank B202 to tank B204. This is necessary to transition from the current state to the next state in the sequence. 2. Close valve_in0: Since the level in tank B201 is already above the required threshold (0.033m > 0.032m), valve_in0 should be closed to prevent overfilling. 3. Ensure all other valves remain closed: valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, and valve_out should remain closed to maintain the current state and prevent any unintended flow. 4. Maintain current pump power: The pump power is currently set to 0.0, which is appropriate as no pumping action is required at this stage.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 1.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m

  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in1 as it is currently open and not required for the current operation. 2. Open valve_in2 to allow the transfer of liquid from tank B203 to tank B204, as the current state requires draining tank B203. 3. Ensure all other valves remain closed as they are not needed for this operation. 4. Keep the pump power at 0.0 as there is no indication that it needs to be adjusted at this stage.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 AS IT IS CURRENTLY OPEN AND NOT REQUIRED FOR THE CURRENT OPERATION. 2. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO ALLOW THE TRANSFER OF LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO TANK B204, AS THE CURRENT STATE REQUIRES DRAINING TANK B203. 3. ENSURE ALL OTHER VALVES REMAIN CLOSED AS THEY ARE NOT NEEDED FOR THIS OPERATION. 4. KEEP THE PUMP POWER AT 0.0 AS THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED AT THIS STAGE.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340976549m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

**Plant Structure:**
  - The system P&ID diagram is as follows (structured as a node-edge format or textual description):
    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:

    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: This valve needs to be open to allow the liquid from tank B201 to flow into the pump. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve needs to be open to allow the liquid to flow from the pump into tank B204. 3. Close valve_in2: Since the current operation is to drain tank B201, valve_in2 should be closed to prevent any inflow from tank B203. 4. Ensure pump power is set to an appropriate level (e.g., 0.5 or 375W) to facilitate the transfer of liquid from tank B201 to tank B204.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

    {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

  **State Graph:**
  - The State Graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states.
  - The transitions happen only when the conditions are met. 
  - The state graph is as follows:
    fill_tank_B201 --> fill_tank_B202 --> fill_tank_B203 --> drain_tank_B201 --> drain_tank_B202 --> drain_tank_B203 --> end
    Below are the transitions and conditions:
    - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202  if B201 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203  if B202 > 0.032m
    - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
    - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
    - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

  - Analyse the state graph and identify the current state of the system.
  - Based on the current state, identify the next state and the conditions required to transition to that state.
  - Take appropriate action to transition to the next state only when the conditions are met.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 0.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: The current state indicates that the level of tank B202 is above the threshold (0.033m > 0.032m), and the system should be transitioning to fill_tank_B203. However, valve_pump_tank_B202 is closed, preventing the flow from tank B202 to the next stage. Opening this valve will allow the process to continue as intended. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 is open: The validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. However, the current state shows it is open (1.0). No action is needed here unless there is a discrepancy in the system's feedback. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201: Since the level of tank B201 is below the threshold (0.0219999998977998m < 0.022m), the system should not be draining from tank B201. Closing this valve will prevent unnecessary flow from tank B201. 4. Adjust pump power: The pump power is currently at 0.0, which is insufficient for any transfer. Increase the pump power to an appropriate level (e.g., 0.5 or 375W) to facilitate the transfer of liquids between tanks.",
  "confirmation": "The suggested corrective actions should be implemented by the plant operator agent to resolve the flagged issues and ensure the system transitions correctly to the next state. This plan should be retried to verify successful operation."

HOWEVER, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS CLOSED, PREVENTING THE FLOW FROM TANK B202 TO THE NEXT STAGE. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW THE PROCESS TO CONTINUE AS INTENDED. 2. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS OPEN: THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT STATE SHOWS IT IS OPEN (1.0). NO ACTION IS NEEDED HERE UNLESS THERE IS A DISCREPANCY IN THE SYSTEM'S FEEDBACK. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201: SINCE THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS BELOW THE THRESHOLD (0.0219999998977998M < 0.022M), THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DRAINING FROM TANK B201. CLOSING THIS VALVE WILL PREVENT UNNECESSARY FLOW FROM TANK B201. 4. ADJUST PUMP POWER: THE PUMP POWER IS CURRENTLY AT 0.0, WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR ANY TRANSFER. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL (E.G., 0.5 OR 375W) TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDS BETWEEN TANKS.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0331283758433468m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m

  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: The current state indicates that the level of tank B202 is above the threshold (0.033m > 0.032m), and the system should be transitioning to fill_tank_B203. However, valve_pump_tank_B202 is closed, preventing the flow from tank B202 to the next stage. Opening this valve will allow the process to continue as intended. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 is open: The validation agent flagged that valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. However, the current state shows it is open (1.0). No action is needed here unless there is a discrepancy in the system's feedback. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B201: Since the level of tank B201 is below the threshold (0.0219999998977998m < 0.022m), the system should not be draining from tank B201. Closing this valve will prevent unnecessary flow from tank B201. 4. Adjust pump power: The pump power is currently at 0.0, which is insufficient for any transfer. Increase the pump power to an appropriate level (e.g., 0.5 or 375W) to facilitate the transfer of liquids between tanks.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

YOU MUST ONLY ADVANCE IF THE TRANSITION CONDITION IS MET. - IF THE CONDITION FOR TRANSITION IS NOT MET, CONTINUE CURRENT OPERATIONS OR RETURN NO NEW ACTIONS. - DO NOT GUESS. DO NOT SKIP STATES.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0219999998977998M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0331283758433468M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTIONS AND FLOW PATHS BETWEEN TANKS AND VALVES. THE P&ID DIAGRAM IS REPRESENTED AS FOLLOWS IN A GRAPH FORMAT:
  {'VALVE_IN0': 'TANK_B201', 'TANK_B201': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201', 'VALVE_IN1': 'TANK_B202', 'TANK_B202': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202', 'VALVE_IN2': 'TANK_B203', 'TANK_B203': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204': 'TANK_B204', 'TANK_B204': 'VALVE_OUT', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203': 'PUMP_N_IN', 'PUMP_N_IN': 'VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204'}

**STATE GRAPH:** - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES AS FOLLOWS:
  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END
  
- BELOW ARE THE TRANSITIONS AND CONDITIONS:
  - FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 IF B201 > 0.032M
  - FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 IF B202 > 0.032M

  - DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END IF B203 < 0.022M

- THINK OF WHAT VALVES AND PUMPS ARE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN OR CLOSED BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE.
**ACTION PROCESS:** - PLEASE FOLLOW THE STATE GRAPH STRICTLY. FOR EACH STATE TRANSITION, CHECK IF THE CONDITIONS ARE MET. - IF THE CONDITION IS MET, PERFORM THE ACTION TO TRANSITION TO THE NEXT STATE. IF NOT, RETURN "NO ACTION" AND MAINTAIN THE CURRENT STATE.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THE CURRENT STATE INDICATES THAT THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS ABOVE THE THRESHOLD (0.033M > 0.032M), AND THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE TRANSITIONING TO FILL_TANK_B203. HOWEVER, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS CLOSED, PREVENTING THE FLOW FROM TANK B202 TO THE NEXT STAGE. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW THE PROCESS TO CONTINUE AS INTENDED. 2. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS OPEN: THE VALIDATION AGENT FLAGGED THAT VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT STATE SHOWS IT IS OPEN (1.0). NO ACTION IS NEEDED HERE UNLESS THERE IS A DISCREPANCY IN THE SYSTEM'S FEEDBACK. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201: SINCE THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS BELOW THE THRESHOLD (0.0219999998977998M < 0.022M), THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE DRAINING FROM TANK B201. CLOSING THIS VALVE WILL PREVENT UNNECESSARY FLOW FROM TANK B201. 4. ADJUST PUMP POWER: THE PUMP POWER IS CURRENTLY AT 0.0, WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT FOR ANY TRANSFER. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL (E.G., 0.5 OR 375W) TO FACILITATE THE TRANSFER OF LIQUIDS BETWEEN TANKS.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B203 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open..
  - Look at the issue and analyze the current state of the system.
  - Identify the valves/pump power casuing this issue and suggest corrective action.
  - Check all the actuators for their current state and suggest corrective action.
  - If more valves are open then required, suggest closing the extra valves and only keeping the required valves open.
  - Do not change the pump power if not required.
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This valve needs to be open to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into the system. The current state shows it is closed, which is causing the issue. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open: This valve is already open, and it should remain so to allow the liquid to flow into tank B204. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently open but not required for the current operation as the system is in the 'drain_tank_B203' state. Closing it will prevent unnecessary flow from tank B202. 4. Keep the pump power at 0.0: Since the system is in a draining state, the pump power does not need to be adjusted at this time.",

**STATE GRAPH:** - THE STATE GRAPH REPRESENTS THE SEQUENCE OF OPERATIONS IN THE PLANT. IT IS A DIRECTED GRAPH WHERE EACH NODE REPRESENTS A STATE AND EACH EDGE REPRESENTS A TRANSITION CONDITION BETWEEN STATES AS FOLLOWS:
  FILL_TANK_B201 → FILL_TANK_B202 → FILL_TANK_B203 → DRAIN_TANK_B201 → DRAIN_TANK_B202 → DRAIN_TANK_B203 → END

**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203: THIS VALVE NEEDS TO BE OPEN TO ALLOW THE LIQUID FROM TANK B203 TO FLOW INTO THE SYSTEM. THE CURRENT STATE SHOWS IT IS CLOSED, WHICH IS CAUSING THE ISSUE. 2. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 REMAINS OPEN: THIS VALVE IS ALREADY OPEN, AND IT SHOULD REMAIN SO TO ALLOW THE LIQUID TO FLOW INTO TANK B204. 3. CLOSE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY OPEN BUT NOT REQUIRED FOR THE CURRENT OPERATION AS THE SYSTEM IS IN THE 'DRAIN_TANK_B203' STATE. CLOSING IT WILL PREVENT UNNECESSARY FLOW FROM TANK B202. 4. KEEP THE PUMP POWER AT 0.0: SINCE THE SYSTEM IS IN A DRAINING STATE, THE PUMP POWER DOES NOT NEED TO BE ADJUSTED AT THIS TIME.
**EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mFollow these rules: - Only act within the current state. Do not anticipate future steps. - Transitions between states follow a strict finite-state machine. You must only advance if the transition condition is met. - If the condition for transition is not met, continue current operations or return no new actions. - Do not guess. Do not skip states.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0219999998977998m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0219999998977997m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0442567375081346m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
**Plant Structure:** - Understand the connections and flow paths between tanks and valves. The P&ID diagram is represented as follows in a graph format:
  {'valve_in0': 'tank_B201', 'tank_B201': 'valve_pump_tank_B201', 'valve_in1': 'tank_B202', 'tank_B202': 'valve_pump_tank_B202', 'valve_in2': 'tank_B203', 'tank_B203': 'valve_pump_tank_B203', 'valve_pump_tank_B204': 'tank_B204', 'tank_B204': 'valve_out', 'valve_pump_tank_B201': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B202': 'pump_n_in', 'valve_pump_tank_B203': 'pump_n_in', 'pump_n_in': 'valve_pump_tank_B204'}

**State Graph:** - The state graph represents the sequence of operations in the plant. It is a directed graph where each node represents a state and each edge represents a transition condition between states as follows:
  fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 → end
  
- Below are the transitions and conditions:
  - fill_tank_B201 → fill_tank_B202 if B201 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B202 → fill_tank_B203 if B202 > 0.032m
  - fill_tank_B203 → drain_tank_B201 if B203 > 0.032m
  - drain_tank_B201 → drain_tank_B202 if B201 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B202 → drain_tank_B203 if B202 < 0.022m
  - drain_tank_B203 → end if B203 < 0.022m

- Think of what valves and pumps are required to be open or closed based on the current state.
**Action Process:** - Please follow the state graph strictly. For each state transition, check if the conditions are met. - If the condition is met, perform the action to transition to the next state. If not, return "no action" and maintain the current state.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B203: This valve needs to be open to allow the liquid from tank B203 to flow into the system. The current state shows it is closed, which is causing the issue. 2. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B204 remains open: This valve is already open, and it should remain so to allow the liquid to flow into tank B204. 3. Close valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve is currently open but not required for the current operation as the system is in the 'drain_tank_B203' state. Closing it will prevent unnecessary flow from tank B202. 4. Keep the pump power at 0.0: Since the system is in a draining state, the pump power does not need to be adjusted at this time.
**Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
