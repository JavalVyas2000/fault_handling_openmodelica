[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:**  **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

The current state of the system indicates that all tanks B201, B202, and B203 are at their minimum level of 0.022m. According to the control sequence, the first step is to fill tank B201 to its maximum capacity of 0.033m. Since valve_in0 is already open, no further action is required at this moment. The system should continue to fill tank B201 until it reaches the specified level before proceeding to the next step.[00m

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.2 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:**  **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:**  **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m

  - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in1 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in1 to ensure flow into the system, as it is currently closed and flagged as an issue. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B201 is open to allow flow from tank B201, as its level is slightly higher than the others, which might help in overcoming the clogging. 4. Keep valve_in0 open and valve_in2 closed to maintain the desired flow path. 5. Keep valve_out closed until the system stabilizes to prevent any premature outflow.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in1 to ensure flow into the system, as it is currently closed and flagged as an issue. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B201 is open to allow flow from tank B201, as its level is slightly higher than the others, which might help in overcoming the clogging. 4. Keep valve_in0 open and valve_in2 closed to maintain the desired flow path. 5. Keep valve_out closed until the system stabilizes to prevent any premature outflow. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  - THE PUMP IS SPEED-CONTROLLED VIA AN INPUT SHAFT SPEED N (RPM), WITH A NOMINAL SPEED OF 166.43 RPM. THE AGENT CAN VARY THE INPUT SPEED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FLOW.
  - THE PUMP FOLLOWS A QUADRATIC HEAD VS. FLOW RATE RELATIONSHIP. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE PUMP CAN DELIVER GREATER HEAD AND FLOW. THE FLOW DIRECTION IS FIXED DUE TO A BUILT-IN CHECK VALVE (NO FLOW REVERSAL ALLOWED). 
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m

  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in1 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in1 to ensure flow into the system. This addresses the flagged issue of valve_in1 not being open. 2. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head to push through any obstructions. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B201 is open to allow flow from tank B201, as its level is slightly higher than the others, indicating it might be the source of flow. 4. Keep valve_out closed to prevent any outflow until the system stabilizes and the tanks are adequately filled.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in1 to ensure flow into the system. This addresses the flagged issue of valve_in1 not being open. 2. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head to push through any obstructions. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B201 is open to allow flow from tank B201, as its level is slightly higher than the others, indicating it might be the source of flow. 4. Keep valve_out closed to prevent any outflow until the system stabilizes and the tanks are adequately filled. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340939285M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.2 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN1 TO ENSURE FLOW INTO THE SYSTEM. THIS ADDRESSES THE FLAGGED ISSUE OF VALVE_IN1 NOT BEING OPEN. 2. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO 0.5 (375W) TO ENHANCE THE FLOW RATE AND OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204. THIS ADJUSTMENT WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT HEAD TO PUSH THROUGH ANY OBSTRUCTIONS. 3. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS OPEN TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B201, AS ITS LEVEL IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE OTHERS, INDICATING IT MIGHT BE THE SOURCE OF FLOW. 4. KEEP VALVE_OUT CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY OUTFLOW UNTIL THE SYSTEM STABILIZES AND THE TANKS ARE ADEQUATELY FILLED. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in1 to ensure flow into the system, as it is currently closed and flagged as an issue. This will help in resolving the flow obstruction. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B201 is open to allow flow from tank B201, as its level is slightly higher than the others, which might help in pushing through any obstruction. 4. Keep valve_in0 open and valve_in2 closed to maintain the desired flow path. 5. Keep valve_out closed to prevent any outflow until the system stabilizes. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in1 to ensure flow into the system, as it is currently closed and flagged as an issue. This will help in resolving the flow obstruction. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B201 is open to allow flow from tank B201, as its level is slightly higher than the others, which might help in pushing through any obstruction. 4. Keep valve_in0 open and valve_in2 closed to maintain the desired flow path. 5. Keep valve_out closed to prevent any outflow until the system stabilizes. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0290092340939285M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.2 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN1 TO ENSURE FLOW INTO THE SYSTEM, AS IT IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND FLAGGED AS AN ISSUE. THIS WILL HELP IN RESOLVING THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION. 2. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER FROM 0.2 TO 0.5 (375W) TO ENHANCE THE FLOW RATE AND OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204. 3. ENSURE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS OPEN TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B201, AS ITS LEVEL IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE OTHERS, WHICH MIGHT HELP IN PUSHING THROUGH ANY OBSTRUCTION. 4. KEEP VALVE_IN0 OPEN AND VALVE_IN2 CLOSED TO MAINTAIN THE DESIRED FLOW PATH. 5. KEEP VALVE_OUT CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY OUTFLOW UNTIL THE SYSTEM STABILIZES. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 to ensure that the flow path is unobstructed and allows fluid to move from the source to the tanks. This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4. Keep all other valves (valve_in0, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out) closed to prevent any unintended flow paths and maintain system integrity.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to ensure that the flow path is unobstructed and allows fluid to move from the source to the tanks. This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4. Keep all other valves (valve_in0, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out) closed to prevent any unintended flow paths and maintain system integrity. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out

This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4. Keep all other valves (valve_in0, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out) closed to prevent any unintended flow paths and maintain system integrity.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to ensure that the flow path is unobstructed and allows fluid to move from the source to the tanks. This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4. Keep all other valves (valve_in0, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out) closed to prevent any unintended flow paths and maintain system integrity. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in2 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in2 to ensure that the flow path is unobstructed and allows fluid to enter the system. This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4.

  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0290092340939285m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.2 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to ensure that the flow path is unobstructed and allows fluid to enter the system. This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4. Keep all other valves (valve_in0, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out) in their current state unless further issues are detected, as they do not appear to be contributing to the current fault. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340939436m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in2 to ensure that the flow path is unobstructed and allows fluid to enter the system. This addresses the issue flagged by the validation agent regarding the valve status. 2. Increase the pump power from 0.2 to 0.5 (375W) to enhance the flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This adjustment will provide sufficient head and flow to clear any obstructions. 3. Ensure that valve_in1 remains open to maintain the current flow path. 4. Keep all other valves (valve_in0, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out) in their current state unless further issues are detected, as they do not appear to be contributing to the current fault. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN2 TO ENSURE THAT THE FLOW PATH IS UNOBSTRUCTED AND ALLOWS FLUID TO ENTER THE SYSTEM. THIS ADDRESSES THE ISSUE FLAGGED BY THE VALIDATION AGENT REGARDING THE VALVE STATUS. 2. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER FROM 0.2 TO 0.5 (375W) TO ENHANCE THE FLOW RATE AND OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 0 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340939436m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: This will allow flow from tank B201, which is currently obstructed due to the valve being closed. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This will enable flow into tank B204, which is necessary for resolving the clogging anomaly. 3. Increase pump power to 0.7 (525W): The current pump power is insufficient to handle the clogging anomaly. Increasing the power will provide the necessary flow rate to overcome the obstruction. 4. Ensure valve_in0 is closed and valve_in1 and valve_in2 remain open: This configuration will direct the flow appropriately through the system, ensuring that tanks B201, B202, and B203 can feed into B204 effectively. 5. Keep valve_out closed: This will prevent any outflow until the system stabilizes and the clogging is resolved. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 0 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: The valve is currently closed, preventing flow from tank B201. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from B201, addressing the issue of the valve not being open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Similarly, this valve is closed, preventing flow to tank B204. Opening it will enable fluid transfer to B204, resolving the flagged issue of the valve not being open. 3. Increase pump power: The current pump power is set at 0.5 times the maximum, which is insufficient to handle the clogging anomaly. Increase the pump power to 0.8 times the maximum (600W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and overcome the obstruction. This adjustment will help achieve the required flow rate of more than 0.000105 m3/s.",

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340939436m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: The valve is currently closed, preventing flow from tank B201. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from B201, addressing the issue of the valve not being open. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Similarly, this valve is closed, preventing flow to tank B204. Opening it will enable fluid transfer to B204, resolving the flagged issue of the valve not being open. 3. Increase pump power: The current pump power is set at 0.5 times the maximum, which is insufficient to handle the clogging anomaly. Increase the pump power to 0.8 times the maximum (600W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and overcome the obstruction. This adjustment will help achieve the required flow rate of more than 0.000105 m3/s. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 19:17:56][✅ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0290092340939436M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.5 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201: THE VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B201. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLUID TO MOVE FROM B201, ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE VALVE NOT BEING OPEN. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: SIMILARLY, THIS VALVE IS CLOSED, PREVENTING FLOW TO TANK B204. OPENING IT WILL ENABLE FLUID TRANSFER TO B204, RESOLVING THE FLAGGED ISSUE OF THE VALVE NOT BEING OPEN. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER: THE CURRENT PUMP POWER IS SET AT 0.5 TIMES THE MAXIMUM, WHICH IS INSUFFICIENT TO HANDLE THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO 0.8 TIMES THE MAXIMUM (600W) TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FLOW RATE AND OVERCOME THE OBSTRUCTION. THIS ADJUSTMENT WILL HELP ACHIEVE THE REQUIRED FLOW RATE OF MORE THAN 0.000105 M3/S. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 0 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0290092340939436m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: The valve is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B201. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from B201 to the next stage. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Similarly, this valve is closed and needs to be opened to allow flow into tank B204. 3. Increase pump power: The current pump power is insufficient to overcome the clogging anomaly. Increase the pump power to 0.75 (562.5W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and pressure to clear the obstruction. 4. Ensure valve_in1 and valve_in2 remain open: These valves are already open and should remain so to maintain the flow path. 5. Monitor the system: After making these adjustments, closely monitor the system to ensure that the flow rates are within expected parameters and that the clogging anomaly is resolved. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: The valve is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B201. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from B201 to the next stage. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: Similarly, this valve is closed and needs to be opened to allow flow into tank B204. 3. Increase pump power: The current pump power is insufficient to overcome the clogging anomaly. Increase the pump power to 0.75 (562.5W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and pressure to clear the obstruction. 4. Ensure valve_in1 and valve_in2 remain open: These valves are already open and should remain so to maintain the flow path. 5. Monitor the system: After making these adjustments, closely monitor the system to ensure that the flow rates are within expected parameters and that the clogging anomaly is resolved. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.75 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 1.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.75 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: The valve is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B202. Opening this valve will allow flow to resume. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: The valve is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B204. Opening this valve will allow flow to resume. 3. Increase pump power to 1.0 (750W): The current pump power is at 0.75, which may not be sufficient to overcome the clogging anomaly. Increasing the pump power to maximum will provide the necessary force to clear any obstructions. 4. Ensure valve_in0 is open: This valve is currently closed, which may be contributing to the flow obstruction. Opening this valve will ensure that the flow path is clear. 5. Monitor the levels of tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204: Ensure that the levels are increasing as expected after making these changes. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.75 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THE VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B202. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLOW TO RESUME. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THE VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B204. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLOW TO RESUME. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER TO 1.0 (750W): THE CURRENT PUMP POWER IS AT 0.75, WHICH MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. INCREASING THE PUMP POWER TO MAXIMUM WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FORCE TO CLEAR ANY OBSTRUCTIONS. 4. ENSURE VALVE_IN0 IS OPEN: THIS VALVE IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH MAY BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ENSURE THAT THE FLOW PATH IS CLEAR. 5. MONITOR THE LEVELS OF TANKS B201, B202, B203, AND B204: ENSURE THAT THE LEVELS ARE INCREASING AS EXPECTED AFTER MAKING THESE CHANGES. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 1.255011961318451e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201: The valve is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B201. Opening this valve will allow flow to resume. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: The valve is currently closed, which is preventing flow to tank B204. Opening this valve will allow flow to resume. 3. Increase pump power: The current pump power is insufficient to handle the clogging anomaly. Increase the pump power to 1.0 (750W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and overcome the obstruction. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve needs to be open to allow flow from tank B202, which is currently closed and causing a flow obstruction. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve also needs to be open to ensure flow continuity to tank B204, which is currently closed and contributing to the flow obstruction. 3. Increase pump power slightly above 1.0 (e.g., 1.1 times max power): This will help overcome any potential clogging anomaly by increasing the flow rate and pressure, ensuring that any obstruction is cleared. 4. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204 to ensure that the flow is restored and the levels are balanced. 5. Ensure valve_out remains closed until the levels in the tanks are stabilized to prevent any premature outflow.",

[2025-04-22 19:19:57][✅ TASK COMPLETED: WHEN THE VALIDATION AGENT DETECTS THAT AN ACTION WAS NOT SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER), THIS AGENT RECEIVES THE FAULT CONTEXT AND CURRENT SYSTEM STATE.
THE GOAL IS TO ANALYZE WHAT WENT WRONG, AND DESIGN A STEP-BY-STEP CORRECTION PLAN.
**CURRENT STATE:**
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M 
  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0
  - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0 
  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
  - THE PUMP POWER IS 1.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.

**SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:**
  - VALVES B201, B202, B203 AND B204 ARE SOLENOID VALVES THAT IS ON OR OFF ONLY. 
  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  - THE PUMP IS SPEED-CONTROLLED VIA AN INPUT SHAFT SPEED N (RPM), WITH A NOMINAL SPEED OF 166.43 RPM. THE AGENT CAN VARY THE INPUT SPEED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FLOW.
  - THE PUMP FOLLOWS A QUADRATIC HEAD VS. FLOW RATE RELATIONSHIP. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE PUMP CAN DELIVER GREATER HEAD AND FLOW. THE FLOW DIRECTION IS FIXED DUE TO A BUILT-IN CHECK VALVE (NO FLOW REVERSAL ALLOWED). 
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS NOT OPEN OR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. EXACTLY 2 DESIRED VALVES ARE NOT OPEN. (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER).
- FAULT DETECTED BY MONITORING AGENT IS  (E.G., CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204).
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

**WHAT TO DO:** - ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND DETECTED FAULTS AND MANIPULATE THE ACUTATORS TO OVERCOME THE ISSUES.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** - LIST OF NEW VALVE/PUMP COMMANDS. - REASONING FOR EACH CHANGE. - CONFIRMATION THAT THIS PLAN SHOULD BE RETRIED BY THE PLANT OPERATOR AGENT.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve needs to be open to allow flow from tank B202, which is currently closed and causing a flow obstruction. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve also needs to be open to ensure flow continuity to tank B204, which is currently closed and contributing to the flow obstruction. 3. Increase pump power slightly above 1.0 (e.g., 1.1 times max power): This will help overcome any potential clogging anomaly by increasing the flow rate and pressure, ensuring that any obstruction is cleared. 4. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204 to ensure that the flow is restored and the levels are balanced. 5. Ensure valve_out remains closed until the levels in the tanks are stabilized to prevent any premature outflow. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0220084238050151m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: This valve needs to be open to allow flow from tank B202, which is currently closed and causing a flow obstruction. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: This valve also needs to be open to ensure flow continuity to tank B204, which is currently closed and contributing to the flow obstruction. 3. Increase pump power slightly above 1.0 (e.g., 1.1 times max power): This will help overcome any potential clogging anomaly by increasing the flow rate and pressure, ensuring that any obstruction is cleared. 4. Monitor the levels in tanks B201, B202, B203, and B204 to ensure that the flow is restored and the levels are balanced. 5. Ensure valve_out remains closed until the levels in the tanks are stabilized to prevent any premature outflow. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0220084238050151M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 1.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM.

IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THIS VALVE NEEDS TO BE OPEN TO ALLOW FLOW FROM TANK B202, WHICH IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND CAUSING A FLOW OBSTRUCTION. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THIS VALVE ALSO NEEDS TO BE OPEN TO ENSURE FLOW CONTINUITY TO TANK B204, WHICH IS CURRENTLY CLOSED AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER SLIGHTLY ABOVE 1.0 (E.G., 1.1 TIMES MAX POWER): THIS WILL HELP OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY BY INCREASING THE FLOW RATE AND PRESSURE, ENSURING THAT ANY OBSTRUCTION IS CLEARED. 4. MONITOR THE LEVELS IN TANKS B201, B202, B203, AND B204 TO ENSURE THAT THE FLOW IS RESTORED AND THE LEVELS ARE BALANCED. 5. ENSURE VALVE_OUT REMAINS CLOSED UNTIL THE LEVELS IN THE TANKS ARE STABILIZED TO PREVENT ANY PREMATURE OUTFLOW. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 1.255011961318468e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204 to ensure proper flow from tanks B201 and B204. This addresses the issue of the valves not being open, which is necessary for the flow to occur. 2. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to overcome the clogging anomaly and ensure sufficient flow rate. The current pump power is insufficient, and increasing it will help in managing the obstruction. 3. Monitor the flow rate and tank levels to ensure that the changes are effective and that the system is stabilizing.",

  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0220084238050151m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204 to ensure proper flow from tanks B201 and B204. This addresses the issue of the valves not being open, which is necessary for the flow to occur. 2. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to overcome the clogging anomaly and ensure sufficient flow rate. The current pump power is insufficient, and increasing it will help in managing the obstruction. 3. Monitor the flow rate and tank levels to ensure that the changes are effective and that the system is stabilizing. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 1.255011961318468e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

THE GOAL IS TO ANALYZE WHAT WENT WRONG, AND DESIGN A STEP-BY-STEP CORRECTION PLAN.
**CURRENT STATE:**
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M 
  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0220084238050151M 
  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0
  - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0 
  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0 
  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
  - THE PUMP POWER IS 1.0 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.

**SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS:**
  - VALVES B201, B202, B203 AND B204 ARE SOLENOID VALVES THAT IS ON OR OFF ONLY. 
  - THE PUMP POWER CAN BE ADJUSTED BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).
  - THE PUMP IS SPEED-CONTROLLED VIA AN INPUT SHAFT SPEED N (RPM), WITH A NOMINAL SPEED OF 166.43 RPM. THE AGENT CAN VARY THE INPUT SPEED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FLOW.
  - THE PUMP FOLLOWS A QUADRATIC HEAD VS. FLOW RATE RELATIONSHIP. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE PUMP CAN DELIVER GREATER HEAD AND FLOW. THE FLOW DIRECTION IS FIXED DUE TO A BUILT-IN CHECK VALVE (NO FLOW REVERSAL ALLOWED). 
  
- VALIDATION AGENT HAS FLAGGED AN ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT OPERATION. 
  - THE ISSUE FLAGGED IS VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS NOT OPEN OR VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS NOT OPEN. EXACTLY 2 DESIRED VALVES ARE NOT OPEN. AND PUMP POWER IS LOW TO HANDLE CLOGGING ANAMOLY. THE MAX PUMP POWER OBSERVED IS 1.255011961318468E-17 M3/S. THE PUMP POWER SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN 0.000105 M3/S. (E.G., FLOW OBSTRUCTION, INCORRECT VALVE STATUS, OR INSUFFICIENT PUMP POWER).
- FAULT DETECTED BY MONITORING AGENT IS  (E.G., CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204).
**ACTUATORS:** - THE AGENT CAN MANIPULATE THE FOLLOWING ACTUATORS:
  - **VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204, VALVE_OUT
  - **PUMP POWER:** ADJUST THE PUMP POWER BETWEEN 0 AND 1 (0 TO 750W).

**WHAT TO DO:** - ANALYZE THE CURRENT STATE AND DETECTED FAULTS AND MANIPULATE THE ACUTATORS TO OVERCOME THE ISSUES.
**OUTPUT FORMAT:** - LIST OF NEW VALVE/PUMP COMMANDS. - REASONING FOR EACH CHANGE. - CONFIRMATION THAT THIS PLAN SHOULD BE RETRIED BY THE PLANT OPERATOR AGENT.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0220084238050151m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 1.0 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204 to ensure proper flow from tanks B201 and B204. This addresses the issue of the valves not being open, which is necessary for the flow path. 2. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to overcome the clogging anomaly and ensure sufficient flow rate. The current pump power is insufficient, and increasing it will help in managing the obstruction. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B202 remains open as it is currently set correctly. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B203 closed as it is not required for the current operation. 5. Monitor the flow rate and adjust the pump power if necessary to maintain a flow rate higher than 0.000105 m3/s. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mWhen the validation agent detects that an action was not successfully executed (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power), this agent receives the fault context and current system state.
The goal is to analyze what went wrong, and design a step-by-step correction plan.
**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B202 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0220084238050151m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: The valve_pump_tank_B202 is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B202. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from tank B202, addressing the flow obstruction issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: The valve_pump_tank_B204 is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B204. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from tank B204, addressing the flow obstruction issue. 3. Increase pump power: Increase the pump power from 0.5 to 0.7 (525W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This will help in maintaining the desired flow rate and pressure. 4. Monitor the system: After making these adjustments, closely monitor the system to ensure that the flow rates and tank levels are stabilizing as expected. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 19:21:29][✅ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0220084238050151M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.5 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B202. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLUID TO MOVE FROM TANK B202, ADDRESSING THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION ISSUE. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B204. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLUID TO MOVE FROM TANK B204, ADDRESSING THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION ISSUE. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER: INCREASE THE PUMP POWER FROM 0.5 TO 0.7 (525W) TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FLOW RATE AND OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204. THIS WILL HELP IN MAINTAINING THE DESIRED FLOW RATE AND PRESSURE. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM: AFTER MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS, CLOSELY MONITOR THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE FLOW RATES AND TANK LEVELS ARE STABILIZING AS EXPECTED. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0220168476100298m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B202: The valve_pump_tank_B202 is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B202. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from tank B202, addressing the flow obstruction issue. 2. Open valve_pump_tank_B204: The valve_pump_tank_B204 is currently closed, which is preventing flow from tank B204. Opening this valve will allow fluid to move from tank B204, addressing the flow obstruction issue. 3. Increase pump power: Increase the pump power from 0.5 to 0.7 (525W) to ensure sufficient flow rate and overcome any potential clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. This will help in maintaining the desired flow rate and pressure. 4. Monitor the system: After making these adjustments, closely monitor the system to ensure that the flow rates and tank levels are stabilizing as expected. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[2025-04-22 19:22:06][✅ TASK COMPLETED: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE FLOW OF LIQUIDS FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO B204 BY OPERATING THE RESPECTIVE VALVES IN A SEQUENTIAL MANNER. THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT. 
**PLANT FUNCTION:** - MIXING OF THREE LIQUIDS, SEQUENTIALLY TRANSFERRED FROM TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 INTO TANK B204.
**PLANT STRUCTURE:** - THE SYSTEM CONSISTS OF FOUR TANKS: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - THERE ARE EIGHT VALVES CONTROLLING LIQUID MOVEMENT:
  - **FILLING VALVES:** VALVE_IN0, VALVE_IN1, VALVE_IN2
  - **PUMPING VALVES:** VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203, VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204
  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**PLANT BEHAVIOR:** - CONTROL SEQUENCE:
  1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M.
  2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M.
  4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING.
  5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**.
  6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**.
  7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
  9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**.
  10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.

**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.0330000001033M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.0220168476100298M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 1.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0 - THE PUMP POWER IS 0.5 TIMES OF MAX PUMP POWER OF 750W.
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED FAULTS IN SYSTEM:** - THE AGENT SHUOLD BE ABLE TO ADJUST FOR A CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE SYSTEM. USUALLY FROM THE PAST EXPERIENCE THE ANOMALY HAPPENS IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS **B201**, **B202**, AND **B203** TO **B204**. - THE AGENT HAS TO DETERMINE A SOLUTION STRATEGY AND HOW IT WOULD MANIPULATE THE VALVES AND THE PUMP POWER TO OVERCOME THE CLOGGING ANOMALY. - THE ACTIONS THAT THE AGENT CAN TAKE ARE BASED ON THE ACTUATORS AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM. I.E. POSITION OF VALVES AND PUMP POWER.
IF A FAULT IS DETECTED, THE MONITORING AGENT WILL MENTION THE FAULT IN THE SYSTEM AND AGENT SHOULD ADJUST FOR IT. FAULT DETECTED = 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTIONS FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202: THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B202. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLUID TO MOVE FROM TANK B202, ADDRESSING THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION ISSUE. 2. OPEN VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204: THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS CURRENTLY CLOSED, WHICH IS PREVENTING FLOW FROM TANK B204. OPENING THIS VALVE WILL ALLOW FLUID TO MOVE FROM TANK B204, ADDRESSING THE FLOW OBSTRUCTION ISSUE. 3. INCREASE PUMP POWER: INCREASE THE PUMP POWER FROM 0.5 TO 0.7 (525W) TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FLOW RATE AND OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING ANOMALY IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204. THIS WILL HELP IN MAINTAINING THE DESIRED FLOW RATE AND PRESSURE. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM: AFTER MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS, CLOSELY MONITOR THE SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT THE FLOW RATES AND TANK LEVELS ARE STABILIZING AS EXPECTED. **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  - The pump is speed-controlled via an input shaft speed N (rpm), with a nominal speed of 166.43 rpm. The agent can vary the input speed to increase or decrease flow.
  - The pump follows a quadratic head vs. flow rate relationship. At higher speeds, the pump can deliver greater head and flow. The flow direction is fixed due to a built-in check valve (no flow reversal allowed). 
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_pump_tank_B201 is not open or valve_pump_tank_B204 is not open. Exactly 2 desired valves are not open. and Pump power is low to handle clogging anamoly. The max pump power observed is 1.2550119613184929e-17 m3/s. The pump power should be higher than 0.000105 m3/s. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is  (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:

  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**Plant Function:** - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.
**Plant Structure:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Plant Behavior:** - Control Sequence:
  1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
  2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
  3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
  4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
  5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
  6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
  7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
  9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
  10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.0330000001033m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.0220168476100298m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 1.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 1.0  - The valve_out is 0.0 - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Faults in system:** - The agent shuold be able to adjust for a clogging anomaly in the system. Usually from the past experience the anomaly happens in the line connecting tanks **B201**, **B202**, and **B203** to **B204**. - The agent has to determine a solution strategy and how it would manipulate the valves and the pump power to overcome the clogging anomaly. - The actions that the agent can take are based on the actuators available in the system. i.e. position of valves and pump power.
If a fault is detected, the monitoring agent will mention the fault in the system and agent should adjust for it. Fault detected = 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggestions for Agent:** 1. Open valve_pump_tank_B201 and valve_pump_tank_B204 to ensure proper flow from tanks B201 and B204. This addresses the issue of the valves not being open, which is necessary for the flow path. 2. Increase the pump power to 0.7 (525W) to overcome the clogging anomaly and ensure the flow rate is above the required 0.000105 m3/s. This adjustment will provide sufficient power to handle the obstruction and maintain the desired flow rate. 3. Ensure valve_pump_tank_B203 remains open as it is currently set to 1.0, which is correct for maintaining flow from tank B203. 4. Keep valve_pump_tank_B202 closed as it is not mentioned in the fault, and opening it may not be necessary for the current operation. 5. Monitor the system for any further anomalies after these adjustments to ensure the flow is restored and maintained. **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
