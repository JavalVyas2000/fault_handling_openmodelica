[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1  - The valve_in1 is 0 - The valve_in2 is 0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0  - The valve_out is 0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:**  Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:**  Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

    - **Output Valve:** valve_out

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m

  - The pump power is 0.0 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in1 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.

  "suggestions": "1. Close valve_in0 to stop filling tank B201 as it is already near its maximum capacity. 2. Open valve_in1 to start filling tank B202, as it is currently at its minimum level and needs to be filled to 0.033m. 3. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to ensure sufficient flow and help overcome any potential clogging in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 4. Monitor the system for any signs of clogging or flow obstruction and adjust the pump power accordingly if needed.",

[1m[95m# Agent:[00m [1m[92mPlant operator[00m
[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 1.0  - The valve_in1 is 0.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Close valve_in0 to stop filling tank B201 as it is already near its maximum capacity. 2. Open valve_in1 to start filling tank B202, as it is currently at its minimum level and needs to be filled to 0.033m. 3. Increase the pump power to 0.5 (375W) to ensure sufficient flow and help overcome any potential clogging in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 4. Monitor the system for any signs of clogging or flow obstruction and adjust the pump power accordingly if needed. Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

**Plant Function:**
  - Mixing of three liquids, sequentially transferred from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into tank B204.

  **Plant Structure:**
  - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**.
  - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
    - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
    - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
    - **Output Valve:** valve_out

  **Plant Behavior:**
  - Control Sequence:
    1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m.
    2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m.
    3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m.
    4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying.
    5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**.
    6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**.
    7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
    9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**.
    10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.

**Current State:**
  - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m 
  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m 
  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m 
  - The valve_in0 is 0.0 
  - The valve_in1 is 1.0
  - The valve_in2 is 0.0
  - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0 
  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0 
  - The valve_out is 0.0
  - The pump power is 0.5 times of max pump power of 750W.

**System Specifications:**
  - Valves B201, B202, B203 and B204 are solenoid valves that is on or off only. 
  - The pump power can be adjusted between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).
  
- Validation agent has flagged an issue with the current operation. 
  - The issue flagged is valve_in0 is not open or exactly 1 desired valve is not open. (e.g., flow obstruction, incorrect valve status, or insufficient pump power).
- Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging (e.g., clogging anomaly in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204).
**Actuators:** - The agent can manipulate the following actuators:
  - **Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2, valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204, valve_out
  - **Pump Power:** Adjust the pump power between 0 and 1 (0 to 750W).

**What to do:** - Analyze the current state and detected faults and manipulate the acutators to overcome the issues.
**Output Format:** - List of new valve/pump commands. - Reasoning for each change. - Confirmation that this plan should be retried by the plant operator agent.

{
  "suggestions": "1. Open valve_in0 to allow filling of tank B201 to its maximum capacity. This is necessary because the current level of B201 is below its maximum, and valve_in0 is currently closed. 2. Close valve_in1 as tank B202 is already at its minimum level and should not be filled further at this stage. 3. Increase the pump power to 0.75 (75% of max power) to ensure sufficient force to overcome any potential clogging in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 4. Monitor the system for any signs of clogging or obstruction and be prepared to adjust the pump power or valve positions as necessary.",
  "confirmation": "This plan should be retried by the plant operator agent to ensure that tank B201 is filled correctly and to address the clogging issue effectively."

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in0 to allow filling of tank B201 to its maximum capacity. This is necessary because the current level of B201 is below its maximum, and valve_in0 is currently closed. 2. Close valve_in1 as tank B202 is already at its minimum level and should not be filled further at this stage. 3. Increase the pump power to 0.75 (75% of max power) to ensure sufficient force to overcome any potential clogging in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 4. Monitor the system for any signs of clogging or obstruction and be prepared to adjust the pump power or valve positions as necessary. Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.

  - **OUTPUT VALVE:** VALVE_OUT

**OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE:** 1. OPEN **VALVE_IN0** TO FILL **TANK B201** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M ONLY AND ONLY IF THE LEVEL IN **TANK B202** AND **TANK B203** BOTH ARE AT THEIR MINIMUM OF 0.022M. 2. ONCE **B201** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN0** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN1** TO FILL **TANK B202** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 3. ONCE **B202** REACHES ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY, CLOSE **VALVE_IN1** AND OPEN **VALVE_IN2** TO FILL **TANK B203** TO MAXIMUM OF 0.033M. 4. ONCE **B203** IS FULL, ALL THREE TANKS ARE READY FOR EMPTYING. 5. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204** TO FILL **B204** AND KEEP IT OPEN WHILE EMPTYING **B201, B202, AND B203**. 6. OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** TO TRANSFER LIQUID FROM **B201 TO B204**. 7. ONCE **B201** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** TO EMPTY **B202** INTO **B204** TILL **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 8. ONCE **B202** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, CLOSE **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202** AND OPEN **VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203** TO EMPTY **B203** INTO **B204** TILL **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M. 9. ONCE **B203** REACHES MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M, ALL LIQUIDS HAVE BEEN MIXED IN **B204**. 10. OPEN **VALVE_OUT** TO EMPTY THE MIXED LIQUID FROM **B204** TILL IT REACHES A MIN LEVEL BETWEEN 0.021M AND 0.22M.
**CURRENT STATE:** - THE LEVEL OF TANK B201 IS 0.0290092340975985M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B202 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B203 IS 0.022M  - THE LEVEL OF TANK B204 IS 0.022M  - THE VALVE_IN0 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_IN1 IS 1.0 - THE VALVE_IN2 IS 0.0 - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B202 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B203 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B204 IS 0.0  - THE VALVE_OUT IS 0.0
STRICTLY FOLLOW THE STEPS IN THAT ORDER. DO NOT SKIP A STEP.  IF THERE ARE NO ACTIONS REQUIRED FROM THE AGENT AS THE LEVELS HAVE NOT HIT THE MAX OR MIN, DO NOT DO ANYTHING AND RETURN THE SAME STATE THE VALVES ARE IN. 
**EXPECTED ACTION:** - THE AGENT SHOULD STRICTLY FOLLOW THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A LIST OF OPERATIONS AT THE CURRENT MOMENT IF ANY CHANGES ARE REQUIRED. - THE AGENT SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR REASONING PROCESS FOR EACH ACTION AND THOUGHT PROCESS.
**SUGGESTED ACTION FOR AGENT:** 1. OPEN VALVE_IN0 TO ALLOW FILLING OF TANK B201 TO ITS MAXIMUM CAPACITY. THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE CURRENT LEVEL OF B201 IS BELOW ITS MAXIMUM, AND VALVE_IN0 IS CURRENTLY CLOSED. 2. CLOSE VALVE_IN1 AS TANK B202 IS ALREADY AT ITS MINIMUM LEVEL AND SHOULD NOT BE FILLED FURTHER AT THIS STAGE. 3. INCREASE THE PUMP POWER TO 0.75 (75% OF MAX POWER) TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FORCE TO OVERCOME ANY POTENTIAL CLOGGING IN THE LINE CONNECTING TANKS B201, B202, AND B203 TO B204. 4. MONITOR THE SYSTEM FOR ANY SIGNS OF CLOGGING OR OBSTRUCTION AND BE PREPARED TO ADJUST THE PUMP POWER OR VALVE POSITIONS AS NECESSARY. FAULT DETECTED BY MONITORING AGENT IS CLOGGING **EXAMPLE ACTION:** - IF **B201** IS EMPTY, THE AGENT SHOULD RETURN: `VALVE_PUMP_TANK_B201 - CLOSE`.

Close valve_in1 as it is currently open, but tank B202 is already at its minimum level, and we need to focus on filling B201 first. 3. Increase pump power to 0.5 (375W) to ensure sufficient flow and help overcome any potential clogging in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 4.

[95m## Task:[00m [92mThe objective is to properly control the flow of liquids from tanks B201, B202, and B203 into B204 by operating the respective valves in a sequential manner. The agent should provide a list of actions that should be carried out at the present moment. 
**System Overview:** - The system consists of four tanks: **B201, B202, B203, B204**. - There are eight valves controlling liquid movement:
  - **Filling Valves:** valve_in0, valve_in1, valve_in2
  - **Pumping Valves:** valve_pump_tank_B201, valve_pump_tank_B202, valve_pump_tank_B203, valve_pump_tank_B204
  - **Output Valve:** valve_out

**Operational Procedure:** 1. Open **valve_in0** to fill **tank B201** to maximum of 0.033m only and only if the level in **tank B202** and **tank B203** both are at their minimum of 0.022m. 2. Once **B201** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in0** and open **valve_in1** to fill **tank B202** to maximum of 0.033m. 3. Once **B202** reaches its maximum capacity, close **valve_in1** and open **valve_in2** to fill **tank B203** to maximum of 0.033m. 4. Once **B203** is full, all three tanks are ready for emptying. 5. Open **valve_pump_tank_B204** to fill **B204** and keep it open while emptying **B201, B202, and B203**. 6. Open **valve_pump_tank_B201** to transfer liquid from **B201 to B204**. 7. Once **B201** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B201** and open **valve_pump_tank_B202** to empty **B202** into **B204** till **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 8. Once **B202** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, close **valve_pump_tank_B202** and open **valve_pump_tank_B203** to empty **B203** into **B204** till **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m. 9. Once **B203** reaches min level between 0.021m and 0.22m, all liquids have been mixed in **B204**. 10. Open **valve_out** to empty the mixed liquid from **B204** till it reaches a min level between 0.021m and 0.22m.
**Current State:** - The level of tank B201 is 0.0290092340975985m  - The level of tank B202 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B203 is 0.022m  - The level of tank B204 is 0.022m  - The valve_in0 is 0.0  - The valve_in1 is 1.0 - The valve_in2 is 0.0 - The valve_pump_tank_B201 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B202 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B203 is 0.0  - The valve_pump_tank_B204 is 0.0  - The valve_out is 0.0
Strictly follow the steps in that order. Do not skip a step.  If there are no actions required from the agent as the levels have not hit the max or min, do not do anything and return the same state the valves are in. 
**Expected Action:** - The agent should strictly follow the operational procedure. - The agent should provide a list of operations at the current moment if any changes are required. - The agent should provide a clear reasoning process for each action and thought process.
**Suggested Action for Agent:** 1. Open valve_in0 to allow filling of tank B201, as it is currently closed and needs to be open to continue the sequence. 2. Close valve_in1 as it is currently open, but tank B202 is already at its minimum level, and we need to focus on filling B201 first. 3. Increase pump power to 0.5 (375W) to ensure sufficient flow and help overcome any potential clogging in the line connecting tanks B201, B202, and B203 to B204. 4. Monitor the system for any signs of clogging or obstruction and be prepared to adjust pump power or valve positions as needed. Fault detected by monitoring agent is clogging **Example Action:** - If **B201** is empty, the agent should return: `valve_pump_tank_B201 - close`.
